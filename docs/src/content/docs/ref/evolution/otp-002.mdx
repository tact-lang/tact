ABI defines how to communicate with smart contracts. It contains information about the contract's receivers, data structures, etc.

## Motivation

ABI is an essential tool that allows developers to generate handy bindings, UIs, etc. One of the best consumer usages would be using a DAO and being able to confirm what exactly it is trying to do before signing a transaction.

## Guide

This OTP is based on types that are defined in TLB+ and it is advised to know them before reading this OTP.

## Specification

ABI is a JSON file:

```json
{
  "name": "MyContract",
  "types": [
    {
      "name": "MyRequest",
      "header": 12315123,
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "queryId",
          "type": {
            "kind": "simple",
            "type": "int",
            "optional": false,
            "format": "uint256"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "receivers": [
    { "type": "binary", "kind": "internal", "name": "MyRequest" },
    { "type": "binary", "kind": "internal" },
    { "type": "comment", "kind": "internal", "comment": "Vote!" },
    { "type": "comment", "kind": "internal" },
    { "type": "empty", "kind": "internal" }
  ],
  "getters": [
    { "name": "getOwner", "type": "address", "args": [] },
    {
      "name": "getBalance",
      "type": "coins",
      "args": [
        {
          "name": "invested",
          "type": {
            "kind": "simple",
            "type": "uint",
            "format": "coins"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "errors": {
    "123": "Error description",
    "124": "Division by zero"
  }
}
```

## Drawbacks

- Binary and compact representation of ABI could be better, but it is not critical for now.

## Prior art

- OTP-001, that is complimentary to this OTP.
