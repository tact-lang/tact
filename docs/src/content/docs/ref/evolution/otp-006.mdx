This proposal defines a way to package compile contracts, their dependencies, and all related metadata into a single file.

## Motivation

A unified package format is needed to simplify the process of deploying and upgrading contracts using various tools without the need to configure them.

## Specification

The package file has an extension `.pkg` and is a JSON file:

```json
{
  "name": "My Contract",
  "code": "... boc of code ...",
  "abi": "ABI string to be uploaded as is to IPFS or Ton Storage",
  "init": {
    "kind": "direct", // Means that this contract can be deployed as is
    "args": {
      // ... Arguments in ABI format
    },
    "prefix": {
      // Optional prefix for contract init state
      "bits": 0, // Number of bits in prefix
      "value": 0 // Value of prefix
    },
    "deployment": {
      "kind": "system-cell", // Means that this contract can be deployed as is
      "system": "... boc of system cell ..."
    }
  },
  "sources": {
    "file.ton": "... base64 encoded source file ..."
  },
  "compiler": {
    "name": "func",
    "version": "0.4.1",
    "parameters": "..." // Optional string parameters
  }
}
```

## Drawbacks

None
