This proposal defines a way to package compiled contract, its dependencies, and all related metadata into a single file.

## Motivation

A unified package format is needed to simplify the process of deploying and upgrading contracts using various tools without the need to configure them.

## Specification

The contract package is defined as a JSON file, usually with a `.pkg` extension:

```json
{
  "name": "ContractName",
  "code": "...base64-encoded BoC...",
  "abi": "...an ABI as a string to be uploaded as is to IPFS or Ton Storage...",
  "init": {
    "kind": "direct", // contract can be deployed as is
    "args": [], // arguments in ABI-like format
    "prefix": { // optional prefix for init()
      "bits": 1, // number of bits
      "value": 0 // value of the prefix
    },
    "deployment": {
      "kind": "system-cell",
      "system": null // removed in Tact 1.6.0
    }
  },
  "sources": {
    "contracts/stdlib.fc": "...base64-encoded source file...",
    "contracts/contract_name.tact": "...base64-encoded source file..."
  },
  "compiler": {
    "name": "tact",
    "version": "1.5.3",
    "parameters": "{...}" // a JSON as a string with an entrypoint and compilation options
  }
}
```

The schema of the specification is typed and accessible via:

```ts
import type { PackageFileFormat } from '@tact-lang/compiler';
```

## Drawbacks

None
