This proposal defines a way to address contracts by their arguments instead of their initial data.

## Motivation

Init data could be very different from the arguments. This allows us to avoid executing untrusted code from another contract in the context of a current one or executing TVM code off-chain for deployment that could be risky in some cases.

## Specification

This specification defines a way to write arguments to an init data cell to be read by the contract code during deployment.

### Prefix

The prefix is defined by a smart contract itself, but by default, it is assumed as a `single zero bit`. Prefix is used by the contract code to distinguish between deployed and not-deployed state.

### Arguments encoding

Arguments are encoded using [Auto Encoder](/ref/evolution/otp-004).

### Contract Requirements

- Contract MUST expose `lazy_deployment_completed` get method that returns `true` if the contract is deployed and `false` otherwise.
- Contract MUST expose `org.ton.deploy.lazy.v0` interface.

## Drawbacks

- Contracts could be in a semi-deployed state
- There are multiple ways to write arguments that would end up in a different init data and a different address
- You can deploy a pre-initialized contract and it would have a different address while being fully functional
- Unpredictable gas usage on deployment. Deployments are usually expensive, but this proposal makes it even more expensive.
