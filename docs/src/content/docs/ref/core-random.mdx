Random number generation for Tact smart contracts.

## random

```tact
fun random(min: Int, max: Int): Int;
```

Generates and returns a new pseudo-random unsigned [`Int{:tact}`][int] value `x` in the provided semi-closed interval: `min` $≤$ `x` $<$ `max` or `min` $≥$ `x` $>$ `max`, if both `min` and `max` are negative. Note, that `max` value is never included in the interval.

Usage examples:

```tact
random(42, 43); // 42, always
random(0, 42);  // 0-41, but never a 42
```

## randomInt

```tact
fun randomInt(): Int;
```

Generates and returns a new pseudo-random unsigned $256$-bit [`Int{:tact}`][int] value `x`.

The algorithm works as follows: if `r` is the old value of the random seed considered a $32$-byte array (by constructing the big-endian representation of an unsigned $256$-bit [`Int{:tact}`][int]), then its `sha512(r){:tact}` is computed. The first $32$ bytes of this hash are stored as the new value `r'` of the random seed, and the remaining $32$ bytes are returned as the next random value `x`.

Usage example:

```tact
let allYourRandomBelongsToUs: Int = randomInt(); // ???, it's random :)
```
