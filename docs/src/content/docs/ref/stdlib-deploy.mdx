Provides unified mechanisms for deployments.

To use this library, import `@stdlib/deploy`:

```tact
import "@stdlib/deploy";
```

## Messages

### Deploy

```tact
message Deploy {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
}
```

### DeployOk

```tact
message DeployOk {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
}
```

### FactoryDeploy

```tact
message FactoryDeploy {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    cashback: Address;
}
```

## Traits

### Deployable

Simplest trait `Deployable{:tact}` that provides a handy unified mechanism for deployments by implementing a simple receiver for the [Deploy](#deploy) message.

All contracts are deployed by sending them a message. While any message can be used for this purpose, best practice is to use the special [Deploy](#deploy) message.

This message has a single field, `queryId`, provided by the deployer (usually set to zero). If the deployment succeeds, the contract will reply with a [DeployOk](#deployok) message and echo the same `queryId` in the response.

Source code:

```tact
trait Deployable {
    receive(deploy: Deploy) {
        self.notify(DeployOk{queryId: deploy.queryId}.toCell());
    }
}
```

Usage example:

```tact /Deployable/
import "@stdlib/deploy";

contract ExampleContract with Deployable {
    // Now, this contract has a receiver for Deploy message
}
```

### FactoryDeployable

Trait `FactoryDeployable{:tact}` provides a handy unified mechanism for chained deployments.

Source code:

```tact
trait FactoryDeployable  {
    receive(deploy: FactoryDeploy) {
        self.forward(deploy.cashback, DeployOk{queryId: deploy.queryId}.toCell(), false, null);
    }
}
```

Usage example:

```tact /FactoryDeployable/
import "@stdlib/deploy";

contract ExampleContract with FactoryDeployable {
    // Now, this contract has a receiver for FactoryDeploy message
}
```
