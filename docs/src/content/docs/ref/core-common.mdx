List of the most commonly used built-in [global static functions](/book/functions#global-static-functions).

## Contextual

### now

```tact
fun now(): Int
```

Returns the current [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

Usage example:

```tact
let timeOffset: Int = now() + 1000; // thousand seconds from now()
```

### myBalance

```tact
fun myBalance(): Int;
```

Returns the [nanoToncoin](/book/integers#nanotoncoin) balance of the smart contract as it was at the start of the [compute phase](https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview#compute-phase) of the current transaction.

Usage example:

```tact
let iNeedADolla: Int = myBalance();
```

:::caution

  Beware, that [all message sending functions](/book/send) of Tact can change the _actual_ contract's balance, but they _won't_ update the value returned by this function.

:::

### myAddress

```tact
fun myAddress(): Address;
```

Returns the address of the current smart contract as an [`Address{:tact}`][p].

Usage example:

```tact
let meMyselfAndI: Address = myAddress();
```

### sender

```tact
fun sender(): Address;
```

Returns the [`Address{:tact}`][p] of the sender of the current message.

Usage example:

```tact
contract MeSee {
    receive() {
        let whoSentMeMessage: Address = sender();
    }
}
```

:::caution

  Behavior is undefined for [getter functions](/book/contracts#getter-functions), because they cannot have a sender nor can they send messages.

:::

:::note

  In order to reduce gas usage, prefer using this function over calling [`context().sender{:tact}`](#context) when you only need to know the sender of the message.

:::

### context

```tact
fun context(): Context;
```

Returns `Context{:tact}` [Struct](/book/structs-and-messages#structs), that consists of:

Field     | Type                  | Description
:-------- | :-------------------- | :----------
`bounced` | [`Bool{:tact}`][bool] | [Bounced](https://ton.org/docs/learn/overviews/addresses#bounceable-vs-non-bounceable-addresses) flag of the incoming message.
`sender`  | [`Address{:tact}`][p] | Internal address of the sender on the TON blockchain.
`value`   | [`Int{:tact}`][int]   | Amount of [nanoToncoins](/book/integers#nanotoncoin) in a message.
`raw`     | [`Slice{:tact}`][slice]   | The remainder of the message as a [`Slice{:tact}`][slice]. It follows [internal message layout](https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/messages#message-layout) of TON starting from the destination [`Address{:tact}`][p] (`dest:MsgAddressInt ` in [TL-B notation](https://docs.ton.org/develop/data-formats/tl-b-language)).

Usage example:

```tact
let ctx: Context = context();
require(ctx.value != 68 + 1, "Invalid amount of nanoToncoins, bye!");
```

:::note

  Note, that if you only need to know who sent the message, use the [`sender(){:tact}`](#sender) function, as it's less gas-consuming.

:::

## Addressing

### newAddress

```tact
fun newAddress(chain: Int, hash: Int): Address;
```

Creates a new [`Address{:tact}`][p] based on the [`chain` id](https://ton-blockchain.github.io/docs/#/overviews/TON_blockchain_overview) and the [SHA-256](/ref/core-math#sha256) encoded [`hash` value](https://docs.ton.org/learn/overviews/addresses#account-id).

This function tries to resolve constant values in [compile-time](/ref/core-comptime) whenever possible.

Usage example:

```tact
let oldTonFoundationAddr: Address =
    newAddress(0, 0x83dfd552e63729b472fcbcc8c45ebcc6691702558b68ec7527e1ba403a0f31a8);
    //         ↑  ------------------------------------------------------------------
    //         |  ↑
    //         |  sha-256 hash of contract's init package (StateInit)
    //         chain id: 0 is a workchain, -1 is a masterchain
```

:::caution

  This method throws an error with [exit code 136](/book/exit-codes#136) if `chain` is invalid or with [exit code 137](/book/exit-codes#137) if `chain` points to the masterchain ($-1$) without [masterchain support](/book/masterchain) enabled.

  [Contract's init package (`StateInit{:tact}`)](/book/expressions#initof)

:::

### contractAddress

```tact
fun contractAddress(s: StateInit): Address;
```

Computes smart contract's [`Address{:tact}`][p] in a workchain $0$ based on its [`StateInit{:tact}`](/book/expressions#initof).

Usage example:

```tact
let foundMeSome: Address = contractAddress(initOf SomeContract());
```

### contractAddressExt

```tact
fun contractAddressExt(chain: Int, code: Cell, data: Cell): Address;
```

Computes smart contract's [`Address{:tact}`][p] based on the `chain` id, contract's `code` and contract's initial state `data`. Use [`initOf{:tact}`](/book/expressions#initof) expression to obtain initial `code` and initial `data` of a given contract.

Usage example:

```tact
let initPkg: StateInit = initOf SomeContract();
let hereBeDragons: Address = contractAddressExt(0, initPkg.code, initPkg.data);
```

:::caution

  This method throws an error with [exit code 136](/book/exit-codes#136) if `chain` is invalid or with [exit code 137](/book/exit-codes#137) if `chain` points to the masterchain ($-1$) without [masterchain support](/book/masterchain) enabled.

:::

:::note

  For this function to work, the compiler option `debug` has to be set to `true{:tact}` for the current project in the [configuration file](/book/config).\
  Read more about debugging on the dedicated page: [Debugging](/book/debug).

:::

## Communication

### send

```tact
fun send(params: SendParameters);
```

[Queues the message](/book/send#outbound-message-processing) to be sent using a [`SendParameters{:tact}`](/book/send) [Struct](/book/structs-and-messages#structs).

Usage example:

```tact
send(SendParameters{
    to: sender(),    // back to the sender,
    value: ton("1"), // with 1 Toncoin (1_000_000_000 nanoToncoin),
                     // and no message body
});
```

:::

### emit

```tact
fun emit(body: Cell);
```

[Queues the message](/book/send#outbound-message-processing) `body` to be sent to the outer world with the purpose of logging and analyzing it later off-chain. The message does not have a recipient and is gas-efficient compared to using any other message sending functions of Tact.

Usage example:

```tact
emit("Catch me if you can, Mr. Holmes".asComment()); // asComment() converts a String to a Cell
```

:::note

  To analyze `emit(){:tact}` calls, one has to look at [external messages](/book/external) produced by the contract.
