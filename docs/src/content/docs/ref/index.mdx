Welcome to the **Reference** section of the Tact documentation — a place for discovering Tact's standard library, grammar specification, and evolution process.

Here are its main contents:

<Steps>

1. #### Core library

   [Core library](/ref/core-base) gives a comprehensive list of auto-included functions, traits, and other constructs with examples of their usage.

   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="Go to the Core library"
       href="/ref/core-base"
     />
   </CardGrid>

2. #### Standard libraries

   The [Standard libraries](/ref/standard-libraries) subsection explains how to use the bundled libraries and lists all their contents with examples of their usage.
   
   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="Go to Standard libraries"
       href="/ref/standard-libraries"
     />
   </CardGrid>

3. #### Specification

   The [Specification](/ref/spec) page is aimed at more experienced programmers but can still be very handy for quickly grasping all possible syntax in the language.
   
   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="Go to the Specification"
       href="/ref/spec"
     />
   </CardGrid>

4. #### Evolution

   Finally, the [Evolution](/ref/evolution/overview) subsection gives insight into important decisions about language semantics, Tact's future, and links to the up-to-date changelog of Tact updates.
   
   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="Go to the Evolution"
       href="/ref/evolution/overview"
     />
   </CardGrid>

</Steps>
