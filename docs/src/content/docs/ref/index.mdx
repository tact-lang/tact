Welcome to the **Reference** section of Tact documentation — a place for discovering the Tact's standard library, grammar specification and evolution process.

Here are its main contents:

<Steps>

1. #### Core library

   [Core library](/ref/core-base) gives a comprehensive list of auto-included functions, traits and other constructs with examples of their usage.

   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="Go to the Core library"
       href="/ref/core-base"
     />
   </CardGrid>

2. #### Standard libraries

   [Standard libraries](/ref/standard-libraries) sub-section explains how to use the bundled libraries, lists all their contents with examples of their usage.
   
   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="Go to Standard libraries"
       href="/ref/standard-libraries"
     />
   </CardGrid>

3. #### Specification

   [Specification](/ref/spec) page provides full Tact grammar written in Ohm language, which is used in the Tact's compiler. Aimed at more experienced programmers, but generally can still be very handy to quickly grasp all of the possible syntax in the language.
   
   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="Go to the Specification"
       href="/ref/spec"
     />
   </CardGrid>

4. #### Evolution

   Finally, [Evolution](/ref/evolution/overview) sub-section gives insight on important decisions about language semantics, Tact's future and links to the up-to-date changelog of Tact updates.
   
   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="Go to the Evolution"
       href="/ref/evolution/overview"
     />
   </CardGrid>
