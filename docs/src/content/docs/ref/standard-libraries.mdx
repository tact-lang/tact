Some libraries (also referred to as standard libraries or stdlibs) come bundled with Tact compiler, but aren't automatically included to your project until explicitly made to.

To import any standard library, use the [`import{:tact}` keyword](/book/import) followed by the name of that library in a [string][p], like so:

```tact
// This would include everything from @stdlib/deploy into your codebase:
import "@stdlib/deploy";
```

Library                  | Description                                                      | Commonly used APIs
:----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------
[`@stdlib/config`][1]    | Config and elector address retrieval.                            | [`getConfigAddress(){:tact}`][gca], [`getElectorAddress(){:tact}`][gea]
[`@stdlib/content`][2]   | Encoding off-chain link [strings][p] to a [`Cell{:tact}`][cell]. | [`createOffchainContent(){:tact}`][coff]
[`@stdlib/deploy`][3]    | Unified mechanism for deployments.                               | [`Deployable{:tact}`][dep], [`FactoryDeployable{:tact}`][fcd]
[`@stdlib/dns`][4]       | Resolution of [DNS][dns] names.                                  | [`DNSResolver{:tact}`][dnsr], [`dnsInternalVerify(){:tact}`][dnsi]
[`@stdlib/ownable`][5]   | Traits for ownership management.                                 | [`Ownable{:tact}`][own], [`OwnableTransferable{:tact}`][ownt]
[`@stdlib/stoppable`][6] | Traits that allow contract stops. Requires [@stdlib/ownable][5]. | [`Stoppable{:tact}`][stp], [`Resumable{:tact}`][res]
