Some libraries (also referred to as standard libraries or stdlibs) come bundled with the Tact compiler but aren't automatically included in your project until explicitly imported.

To import any standard library, use the [`import{:tact}` keyword](/book/import) followed by the name of that library in a [string][p], like so:

```tact
// This would include everything from @stdlib/deploy into your codebase:
import "@stdlib/deploy";
```

Library                  | Description                                                      | Commonly used APIs
:----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------
[`@stdlib/config`][1]    | Retrieval of config and elector addresses.                       | [`getConfigAddress(){:tact}`][gca], [`getElectorAddress(){:tact}`][gea]
[`@stdlib/content`][2]   | Encoding off-chain link [strings][p] into a [`Cell{:tact}`][cell]. | [`createOffchainContent(){:tact}`][coff]
[`@stdlib/deploy`][3]    | Unified mechanism for deployments.                               | **Deprecated**: [`Deployable{:tact}`][dep], [`FactoryDeployable{:tact}`][fcd]
[`@stdlib/dns`][4]       | Resolution of [DNS][dns] names.                                  | [`DNSResolver{:tact}`][dnsr], [`dnsInternalVerify(){:tact}`][dnsi]
[`@stdlib/ownable`][5]   | Traits for ownership management.                                 | [`Ownable{:tact}`][own], [`OwnableTransferable{:tact}`][ownt]
[`@stdlib/stoppable`][6] | Traits that allow contracts to be stopped. Requires [@stdlib/ownable][5]. | [`Stoppable{:tact}`][stp], [`Resumable{:tact}`][res]
