import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Various cryptographic global functions. Crypto-oriented extension functions for [`Cell{:tact}`][cell], [`Builder{:tact}`][builder], and [`Slice{:tact}`][slice] types are listed on their reference page: [Cells, Builders and Slices](/ref/core-cells).

## checkSignature

```tact
fun checkSignature(hash: Int, signature: Slice, publicKey: Int): Bool;
```

Checks the [Ed25519][ed] `signature` of the 256-bit unsigned [`Int{:tact}`][int] `hash` using a `publicKey`, represented by a 256-bit unsigned [`Int{:tact}`][int]. The signature must contain at least 512 bits of data, but only the first 512 bits are used.

Returns `true{:tact}` if the signature is valid, `false{:tact}` otherwise.

Usage example:

```tact {19-24}
message ExtMsg {
    signature: Slice;
    data: Cell;
}

contract Showcase {
    // Persistent state variables
    pub: Int as uint256; // public key as a 256-bit unsigned Int

    // Constructor function init(), where all variables are initialized
    init(pub: Int) {
        self.pub = pub; // storing the public key upon contract initialization
    }

    // External message receiver, which accepts message ExtMsg
    external(msg: ExtMsg) {
        let hash: Int = beginCell().storeRef(msg.data).endCell().hash();
        let check: Bool = checkSignature(hash, msg.signature, self.pub);
        //                               ----  -------------  --------
        //                               ↑     ↑              ↑
        //                               |     |              publicKey stored in our contract
        //                               |     signature obtained from the received message
        //                               hash calculated using the data from the received message
        // ... follow-up logic ...
    }
}
```

:::caution

  The first 10 calls of this function are very cheap regarding gas usage. However, the 11th call and onward consume more than 4 thousand gas units.

## checkDataSignature

```tact
fun checkDataSignature(data: Slice, signature: Slice, publicKey: Int): Bool;
```

Checks the [Ed25519][ed] `signature` of the `data` using a `publicKey`, similar to [`checkSignature(){:tact}`](#checksignature). If the bit length of `data` is not divisible by 8, this function throws an error with [exit code 9](/book/exit-codes#9): `Cell underflow`. Verification itself is done indirectly on a [SHA-256][sha-2] hash of the `data`.

Returns `true{:tact}` if the signature is valid, `false{:tact}` otherwise.

Usage example:

```tact
let data: Slice = someData;
let signature: Slice = someSignature;
let publicKey: Int = 42;

let check: Bool = checkDataSignature(data, signature, publicKey);
```

## SignedBundle

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.6.6" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

```tact
struct SignedBundle {
    /// A 512-bit Ed25519 signature of the `signedData`.
    signature: Slice as bytes64;

    /// The remaining non-serialized data of the enclosing struct or message struct,
    /// which was used to obtain the 512-bit Ed25519 `signature`.
    signedData: Slice as remaining;
}
```

A [struct][struct] that contains a 512-bit [Ed25519][ed] signature and the data it signs.

See the usage example for the [`SignedBundle.verifySignature(){:tact}`](#signedbundleverifysignature) function.

## SignedBundle.verifySignature

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.6.6" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

```tact
extends fun verifySignature(self: SignedBundle, publicKey: Int): Bool;
```

Extension function for the [`SignedBundle{:tact}`](#signedbundle) [struct][struct].

Checks whether `self.signedData` was signed by the 512-bit [Ed25519][ed] signature `self.signature`, using the given `publicKey`. Returns `true` if the signature is valid, `false` otherwise.

Usage example:

```tact
contract Example(publicKey: Int as uint256) {
    external(msg: MessageWithSignedData) {
        // Checks that the signature of the SignedBundle from the incoming external
        // message wasn't forged and made by the owner of this self.publicKey with
        // its respective private key managed elsewhere.
        throwUnless(35, msg.bundle.verifySignature(self.publicKey));

        // ...rest of the checks and code...
    }
}

message MessageWithSignedData {
    // The `bundle.signature` contains the 512-bit Ed25519 signature
    // of the remaining data fields of this message struct,
    // while `bundle.signedData` references those data fields.
    // In this case, the fields are `walletId` and `seqno`.
    bundle: SignedBundle;

    // These fields are common to external messages to user wallets.
    walletId: Int as int32;
    seqno: Int as uint32;
}
```

## sha256

<Badge text="Gas-expensive" title="Uses 500 gas units or more" variant="danger" size="medium"/><p/>

```tact
fun sha256(data: Slice): Int;
fun sha256(data: String): Int;
```

Computes and returns the [SHA-256][sha-2] hash as a $256$-bit unsigned [`Int{:tact}`][int] from the passed [`Slice{:tact}`][slice] or [`String{:tact}`][p] `data`, which should have a number of bits divisible by $8$.

In case `data` is a [`Slice{:tact}`][slice], it must have no more than a single reference per cell, because only the first reference of each nested cell will be taken into account.

This function tries to resolve constant string values at [compile-time](/ref/core-comptime) whenever possible.

Attempts to specify a [`Slice{:tact}`][slice] or [`String{:tact}`][p] with a number of bits **not** divisible by $8$ throw an exception with [exit code 9](/book/exit-codes#9): `Cell underflow`.

Usage examples:

```tact
sha256(beginCell().asSlice());
sha256("Hello, world!"); // will be resolved at compile-time
sha256(someVariableElsewhere); // will try to resolve at compile-time,
                               // and fall back to run-time evaluation
```

:::tip[Before Tact 1.6]

  Previously, if a [`String{:tact}`][p] value couldn't be resolved during [compile-time](/ref/core-comptime), the hash was calculated at runtime by the [TVM][tvm] itself. This caused collisions of strings with more than 127 bytes if their first 127 bytes were the same.

  That's because all [SHA-256][sha-2]-related instructions of the [TVM][tvm] consider only the data bits, ignoring possible references to other cells needed to form larger strings.

  Therefore, in general, and in versions of Tact prior to 1.6, it is preferable to use statically known strings whenever possible. When in doubt, use strings of up to 127 bytes long.

## normalizeECDSARecoveryId

```tact
fun normalizeECDSARecoveryId(v: Int): Int;
```

Normalizes the 8-bit unsigned integer `v` to be correct for ECDSA recovery for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

:::note

  In TVM, `v` can be only `0` or `1`, but in ETH / BTC, a prefix is used.

:::

See [RFC6979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979) and [Bitcoin Stack Exchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/38351/ecdsa-v-r-s-what-is-v).

Usage example:

```tact
fun example() {
    let v: Int = 28; // Bitcoin adds 27 to the recovery ID
    let normalized: Int = normalizeECDSARecoveryId(v);
    ecrecover(..., normalized, ...);
}
```

## EcrecoverKey

```tact
struct EcrecoverKey {
    h: Int as uint8;
    x1: Int as uint256;
    x2: Int as uint256;
}
```

A [struct][struct] that contains the 8-bit unsigned integer `h`, and the 256-bit unsigned integers `x1` and `x2`.

## ecrecover

```tact
fun ecrecover(hash: Int, v: Int, r: Int, s: Int): EcrecoverKey?;
```

Recovers a public key from the signature as done in Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Takes the 256-bit unsigned integer `hash` and the 65-byte signature consisting of:

* 8-bit unsigned integer `v`
* 256-bit unsigned integers `r` and `s`

Returns `null` on failure or an `EcrecoverKey` structure on success.

:::note

  In TVM, `v` can be only `0` or `1`. To normalize it for BTC / ETH, use [`normalizeECDSARecoveryId()`](#normalizeecdsarecoveryid) first.
