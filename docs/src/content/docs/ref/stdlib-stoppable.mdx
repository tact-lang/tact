Provides [traits](/book/types#composite-types) that allow stopping a [contract](/book/contracts). Useful for emergency or maintenance modes. Requires an [`Ownable{:tact}`](/ref/stdlib-ownable#ownable) trait from [`@stdlib/ownable`](/ref/stdlib-ownable). This trait manages a single flag `stopped` in the contract, and handling the stopped state must be done in the contract itself.

To use this library, import `@stdlib/stoppable`:

```tact
import "@stdlib/stoppable"; // this would automatically import @stdlib/ownable too!
```

## Traits

### Stoppable

[Trait](/book/types#composite-types) `Stoppable{:tact}` implements a receiver for the [Message](/book/structs-and-messages#messages) [string](/book/types#primitive-types) "Stop" that can be sent by the owner. It implements the `stopped(){:tact}` [getter function](/book/functions#getter-functions) that returns `true{:tact}` if the contract is stopped (or `false{:tact}` otherwise) and provides private (non-getter) functions `requireNotStopped(){:tact}` and `requireStopped(){:tact}`.

Source code:

```tact
@interface("org.ton.stoppable")
trait Stoppable with Ownable {
    /// Whether the contract is stopped.
    stopped: Bool;

    /// The owner of the contract.
    owner: Address;

    /// Requires the contract to be not stopped.
    ///
    /// #### Error codes
    ///
    /// * 133 â€” if the contract is stopped
    ///
    fun requireNotStopped() {
        throwUnless(TactExitCodeContractStopped, !self.stopped);
    }

    /// Requires the contract to be stopped.
    fun requireStopped() {
        require(self.stopped, "Contract not stopped");
    }

    /// Receiver for the message `"Stop"` that stops the contract.
    ///
    /// Can only be called by the owner and if the contract is not stopped already.
    receive("Stop") {
        self.requireOwner();
        self.requireNotStopped();
        self.stopped = true;
        self.reply("Stopped".asComment());
    }

    /// Returns `true` if the contract is stopped (or `false` otherwise).
    get fun stopped(): Bool {
        return self.stopped;
    }
}
```

Usage example:

```tact /Stoppable/
import "@stdlib/ownable";
import "@stdlib/stoppable";

contract MyContract with Stoppable {
    owner: Address;
    stopped: Bool;

    init(owner: Address) {
        self.owner = owner;
        self.stopped = false;
    }
}
```

### Resumable

The `Resumable{:tact}` [trait](/book/types#composite-types) extends the [`Stoppable{:tact}`](#stoppable) trait and allows resuming [contract](/book/contracts) execution.

Source code:

```tact
@interface("org.ton.resumable")
trait Resumable with Stoppable {
    /// Whether the contract is stopped.
    stopped: Bool;

    /// The owner of the contract.
    owner: Address;

    /// Receiver for the message `"Resume"` that resumes the contract execution.
    ///
    /// Can only be called by the owner and if the contract is stopped.
    receive("Resume") {
        self.requireOwner();
        self.requireStopped();
        self.stopped = false;
        self.reply("Resumed".asComment());
    }
}
```

Usage example:

```tact /Resumable/
import "@stdlib/ownable";
import "@stdlib/stoppable";

contract MyContract with Resumable {
    owner: Address;
    stopped: Bool;

    init(owner: Address) {
        self.owner = owner;
        self.stopped = false;
    }
}
```
