Contextual and state-related functions and structs.

## Time

### now

```tact
fun now(): Int;
```

Returns the current [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

Usage example:

```tact
let timeOffset: Int = now() + 1000; // thousand seconds from now()
```

### curLt

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.6" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

```tact
fun curLt(): Int;
```

Returns the [`Int{:tact}`][int] value of the [logical time][lt] of the current transaction.

Usage example:

```tact
let lt: Int = curLt();
nativeRandomize(lt); // Equivalent to calling nativeRandomizeLt()
```

### blockLt

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.6" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

```tact
fun blockLt(): Int;
```

Returns the [`Int{:tact}`][int] value of the [starting logical time][lt] of the current block.

Usage example:

```tact
let time: Int = blockLt();
```

## Incoming message

### sender

```tact
fun sender(): Address;
```

Returns the [`Address{:tact}`][p] of the sender of the current message.

Usage example:

```tact
contract MeSee {
    receive() {
        let whoSentMeMessage: Address = sender();
    }
}
```

:::caution

  Behavior is undefined for [getter functions](/book/contracts#getter-functions), because they cannot have a sender nor can they send messages.

:::

:::note

  In order to reduce gas usage, prefer using this function over calling [`context().sender{:tact}`](#context) when you only need to know the sender of the message.

:::

### context

```tact
fun context(): Context;
```

Returns `Context{:tact}` [struct][struct], which consists of:

Field        | Type                    | Description
:----------- | :---------------------- | :----------
`bounceable` | [`Bool{:tact}`][bool]   | Indicates whether the received message can [bounce back](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/non-bounceable-messages).
`sender`     | [`Address{:tact}`][p]   | Internal address of the sender on the TON Blockchain.
`value`      | [`Int{:tact}`][int]     | Amount of [nanoToncoin][nano] in the received message.
`raw`        | [`Slice{:tact}`][slice] | The remainder of the received message as a [`Slice{:tact}`][slice]. It follows the [internal message layout](https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/messages#message-layout) of TON, starting from the destination [`Address{:tact}`][p] (`MsgAddressInt` in [TL-B notation](https://docs.ton.org/develop/data-formats/tl-b-language)).

Usage example:

```tact
let ctx: Context = context();
require(ctx.value != 68 + 1, "Invalid amount of nanoToncoins, bye!");
```

:::note

  If you only need to know who sent the message, use the [`sender(){:tact}`](#sender) function, as it is less gas-consuming.

:::

### Context.readForwardFee

```tact
extends fun readForwardFee(self: Context): Int;
```

Extension function for the [`Context{:tact}`](#context) [struct][struct].

Reads the [forward fee][forward-fee] and returns it as an [`Int{:tact}`][int] amount of [nanoToncoin][nano].

Usage example:

```tact
let fwdFee: Int = context().readForwardFee();
```

## Contract and transaction state

### myAddress

```tact
fun myAddress(): Address;
```

Returns the address of the current smart contract as an [`Address{:tact}`][p].

Usage example:

```tact
let meMyselfAndI: Address = myAddress();
```

:::note[Useful links:]

:::

### myCode

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.6" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

```tact
fun myCode(): Cell;
```

Returns the smart contract code [`Cell{:tact}`][cell] obtained from the `c7` [register][registers].

Usage example:

```tact
let code: Cell = myCode();
```

### myStorageDue

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.5" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

```tact
fun myStorageDue(): Int;
```

Returns the [nanoToncoin][nano] [`Int{:tact}`][int] amount of the accumulated [storage fee][storage-fee] debt. Storage fees are deducted from the incoming message value before the new contract balance is calculated.

Usage example:

```tact
let debt: Int = myStorageDue();
```

:::note[Useful links:]

  [Other fees and gas-related functions in the Core library](/ref/core-gas)

:::

### myBalance

```tact
fun myBalance(): Int;
```

Returns the [nanoToncoin][nano] [`Int{:tact}`][int] balance of the smart contract as it was at the start of the [compute phase](https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview#compute-phase) of the current transaction.

Usage example:

```tact
let iNeedADolla: Int = myBalance();
```

:::caution

  Beware that [all message-sending functions](/book/send#message-sending-functions) of Tact can change the _actual_ balance of the contract, but they **won't** update the value returned by this function.

:::

### gasConsumed

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.5" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

```tact
fun gasConsumed(): Int;
```

Returns the [nanoToncoin][nano] [`Int{:tact}`][int] amount of [gas][gas] consumed by [TVM][tvm] in the current transaction so far. The resulting value includes the cost of calling this function.

Usage example:

```tact
let gas: Int = gasConsumed();
```

### nativeReserve

<Badge text="Gas-expensive" title="Uses 500 gas units or more" variant="danger" size="medium"/><p/>

```tact
fun nativeReserve(amount: Int, mode: Int);
```

Executes the native `RAWRESERVE` instruction with the specified amount and mode. The `RAWRESERVE` instruction creates an output action to reserve a specific amount of [nanoToncoin][nano] from the remaining balance of the account.

The `RAWRESERVE` instruction takes two arguments:
* `amount`: The number of [nanoToncoin][nano] to reserve.
* `mode`: Determines the reservation behavior.

The `RAWRESERVE` instruction is roughly equivalent to creating an outbound message carrying the specified `amount` of [nanoToncoin][nano] (or `b - amount` [nanoToncoin][nano], where `b` is the remaining balance) to oneself. This ensures that subsequent output actions cannot spend more money than the remainder.

It is possible to use raw [`Int{:tact}`][int] values and manually provide them for the `mode`, but for your convenience, there's a set of constants you may use to construct the compound `mode` with ease. Take a look at the following tables for more information on base modes and optional flags.

:::caution

  Currently, `amount` must be a non-negative integer, and `mode` must be in the range $0..31$, inclusive.

  Additionally, attempts to queue more than $255$ reservations in one transaction throw an exception with [exit code 33](/book/exit-codes#33): `Action list is too long`.

:::

#### Base modes {#nativereserve-base-modes}

The resulting `mode` value can have the following base modes:

Mode value | Constant name                 | Description
---------: | :---------------------------- | -----------
$0$        | `ReserveExact{:tact}`         | Reserves exactly the specified `amount` of [nanoToncoin][nano].
$1$        | `ReserveAllExcept{:tact}`     | Reserves all but the specified `amount` of [nanoToncoin][nano].
$2$        | `ReserveAtMost{:tact}`        | Reserves at most the specified `amount` of [nanoToncoin][nano].

#### Optional flags {#nativereserve-optional-flags}

Additionally, the resulting `mode` can have the following optional flags added:

Flag value | Constant name                      | Description
---------: | :--------------------------------- | -----------
$+4$       | `ReserveAddOriginalBalance{:tact}` | Increases the `amount` by the original balance of the current account (before the compute phase), including all extra currencies.
$+8$       | `ReserveInvertSign{:tact}`         | Negates the `amount` value before performing the reservation.
$+16$      | `ReserveBounceIfActionFail{:tact}` | Bounces the transaction if the reservation fails.

#### Combining modes with flags {#nativereserve-combining-modes-with-flags}

To construct the [`Int{:tact}`][int] value for the `mode` parameter, combine base modes with optional flags by applying the [bitwise OR](/book/operators#binary-bitwise-or) operation:

```tact
nativeReserve(ton("0.1"), ReserveExact | ReserveBounceIfActionFail);
//            ----------  ----------------------------------------
//            ↑           ↑
//            |           mode, which would bounce the transaction if exact reservation fails
//            amount of nanoToncoins to reserve
```

### commit

```tact
fun commit();
```

Commits the current state of [registers][registers] `c4` (persistent data) and `c5` (actions), so that the current execution is considered "successful" with the saved values even if an exception in the compute phase is thrown later.

Usage example:

```tact {1}
commit();  // now, transaction is considered "successful"
throw(42); // and this won't fail it
```

## Blockchain state

### getConfigParam

```tact
fun getConfigParam(id: Int): Cell?;
```

Loads a [configuration parameter](https://docs.ton.org/develop/howto/blockchain-configs) of TON Blockchain by its `id` number.

Usage examples:

```tact
// Parameter 0, address of a special smart contract that stores the blockchain's configuration
let configAddrAsCell: Cell = getConfigParam(0)!!;

// Parameter 18, configuration for determining the prices for data storage
let dataStorageFeeConfig: Cell = getConfigParam(18)!!;
```

:::note

  The standard library [`@stdlib/config`](/ref/stdlib-config) provides two related helper functions:\
  [`getConfigAddress(){:tact}`](/ref/stdlib-config#getconfigaddress) for retrieving config [`Address{:tact}`][p]\
  [`getElectorAddress(){:tact}`](/ref/stdlib-config#getconfigaddress) for retrieving elector [`Address{:tact}`][p]

  Read more about other parameters: [Config Parameters in TON Docs](https://docs.ton.org/develop/howto/blockchain-configs).
