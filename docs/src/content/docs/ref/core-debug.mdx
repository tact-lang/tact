List of functions commonly used for debugging smart contracts in Tact.

Read more about debugging on the dedicated page: [Debugging](/book/debug).

## require

```tact
fun require(condition: Bool, error: String);
```

Checks the `condition` and throws an error with an [exit code](/book/exit-codes) generated from the `error` message if the `condition` is `false{:tact}`. Does nothing otherwise.

The algorithm for generating the exit code works as follows:

* First, the [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Hash_standard) hash of `error` message [`String{:tact}`][p] is obtained.
* Then, its value is read as a 32-bit [big-endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) number modulo $63000$ plus $1000$, in that order.
* Finally, it's put into the `.md` compilation report file, which resides with the other compilation artifacts in your project's `outputs/` or `build/` directories.

The generated exit code is guaranteed to be outside the common $0 - 255$ range reserved for TVM and Tact contract errors, which makes it possible to distinguish exit codes from `require(){:tact}` and any other [standard exit codes](/book/exit-codes).

Usage examples:

```tact
// now() has to return a value greater than 1000, otherwise an error message will be thrown
require(now() > 1000, "We're in the first 1000 seconds of 1 January 1970!");

try {
    // The following will never be true, so this require would always throw
    require(now() < -1, "Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.");
} catch (e) {
    // e will be outside of range 0-255
    dump(e);
}
```

## dump

```tact
fun dump(arg);
```

Prints the argument `arg` to the contract's debug console. Evaluated only if the `debug` option in the [configuration file](/book/config) is set to `true{:json}`, otherwise does nothing.

This function is computationally expensive and consumes a lot of gas because it prints the location from which it was called, i.e. the filename, line and column numbers, and the original expression that was the `arg` argument.

Can be applied to the following list of types and values:

* [`Int{:tact}`][int]
* [`Bool{:tact}`][bool]
* [`Address{:tact}`][p]
* [`Cell{:tact}`][cell], [`Builder{:tact}`][builder] or [`Slice{:tact}`][slice]
* [`String{:tact}`][p] or [`StringBuilder{:tact}`][p]
* [`map<K, V>{:tact}`](/book/maps)
* [Optionals and `null{:tact}` value](/book/optionals)
* `void`, which is implicitly returned when a function doesn't have return value defined

Usage examples:

```tact
// Int
dump(42); // prints:
          // File filename.tact:2:1
          // dump(42)
          // 42

// Bool
dump(true);
dump(false);

// Address
dump(myAddress());

// Cell, Builder or Slice
dump(emptyCell());  // Cell
dump(beginCell());  // Builder
dump(emptySlice()); // Slice

// String or StringBuilder
dump("Hello, my name is..."); // String
dump(beginTailString());      // StringBuilder

// Maps
let m: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();
m.set(2 + 2, 4);
dump(m);

// Special values
dump(null);
dump(emit("msg".asComment())); // As emit() function doesn't return a value, dump() would print #DEBUG#: void.
```

## dumpStack

```tact
fun dumpStack();
```

Prints the total stack depth and up to $255$ of its values from the top to the contract's debug console. The values are positioned bottom-up: from the deepest value on the left to the topmost value on the right. Evaluated only if the `debug` option in the [configuration file](/book/config) is set to `true{:json}`, otherwise does nothing.

Usage example:

```tact
dumpStack(); // prints:
             // File filename.tact:1:1
             // dumpStack()
             // stack(3 values) : 100000000 C{96...C7} 0
```

## throw

```tact
fun throw(code: Int);
```

An alias to [`nativeThrow(){:tact}`](#nativethrow).

## nativeThrow

```tact
fun nativeThrow(code: Int);
````

Throws an exception with an error code equal to `code`. Execution of the current context stops (the statements after `nativeThrow` won't be executed) and control will be passed to the first [`try...catch{:tact}` block](/book/statements#try-catch) in the call stack. If no `try{:tact}` or `try...catch{:tact}` block exists among caller functions, [TVM](https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview) will terminate the transaction.

Attempts to specify the `code` outside of $0 - 65535$ range cause an exception with [exit code 5](/book/exit-codes#5): `Integer out of expected range`.

Usage examples:

```tact {2,7}
fun thisWillTerminate() {
    nativeThrow(42); // throwing with exit code 42
}

fun butThisDoesNot() {
    try {
        nativeThrow(42); // throwing with exit code 42
    }

    // ... follow-up logic ...
}
```

## nativeThrowIf

```tact
fun nativeThrowIf(code: Int, condition: Bool);
```

Similar to [`nativeThrow(){:tact}`](#nativethrow), but throws an exception conditionally, when `condition` is equal to `true{:tact}`. Doesn't throw otherwise.

Attempts to specify the `code` outside of $0 - 65535$ range cause an exception with [exit code 5](/book/exit-codes#5): `Integer out of expected range`.

Usage examples:

```tact {2,7}
fun thisWillTerminate() {
    nativeThrowIf(42, true); // throwing with exit code 42
}

fun butThisDoesNot() {
    try {
        nativeThrowIf(42, true); // throwing with exit code 42
    }
    // ... follow-up logic ...
}
```

## nativeThrowUnless

```tact
fun nativeThrowUnless(code: Int, condition: Bool);
```

Similar to [`nativeThrow(){:tact}`](#nativethrow), but throws an exception conditionally, when `condition` is equal to `false{:tact}`. Doesn't throw otherwise.

Attempts to specify the `code` outside of $0 - 65535$ range cause an exception with [exit code 5](/book/exit-codes#5): `Integer out of expected range`.

Usage examples:

```tact {2,7}
fun thisWillTerminate() {
    nativeThrowUnless(42, false); // throwing with exit code 42
}

fun butThisDoesNot() {
    try {
        nativeThrowUnless(42, false); // throwing with exit code 42
    }
    // ... follow-up logic ...
}
