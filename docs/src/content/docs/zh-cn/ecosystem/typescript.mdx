title: Typescript Libraries
---

Tact language has built-in support for `ton` and `ton-core` typescript libraries. Compiler generates code for these libraries automatically and you can use libraries like [@tact-lang/emulator](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-emulator), [@ton-community/sandbox](https://github.com/ton-community/sandbox).

## Tact contract in Typescript

Compiler generates files named `{project}_{contract}.ts` for each contract in your project that contains ready-to use strongly typed wrappers to work with a contract in any environment: for testing, deployments, etc.
