This page lists examples of communication between a single deployed contract and other contracts on blockchain.

For examples of communication between multiple deployed contracts, see: [Multi-contract communication](/cookbook/multi-communication).

## How to make a basic reply

```tact
contract Example {
    receive() {
        self.reply("Hello, World!".asComment()); // asComment converts a String to a Cell with a comment
    }
}
```

## How to send a simple message

```tact
contract Example {
    receive() {
        send(SendParameters {
            bounce: true, // default
            to: sender(), // or another destination address
            value: ton("0.01"), // attached amount of TON to send
            body: "Hello from Tact!".asComment(), // comment (optional)
        });
    }
}
```

## How to send a message with the entire balance

If we need to send the whole balance of the smart contract, we should use the `SendRemainingBalance{:tact}` send mode. Alternatively, we can use `mode: 128{:tact}`, which has the same meaning.

```tact
contract Example {
    receive() {
        send(SendParameters {
            // bounce = true by default
            to: sender(), // send the message back to the original sender
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingBalance, // or mode: 128
            body: "Hello from Tact!".asComment(), // comment (optional)
        });
    }
}
```

## How to send a message with the remaining value

If we want to send a reply to the same sender, we can use the mode `SendRemainingValue{:tact}` (i.e. `mode: 64{:tact}`), which carries all the remaining value of the inbound message in addition to the value initially indicated in the new message.

```tact
contract Example {
    receive() {
        send(SendParameters {
            // bounce = true by default
            to: sender(), // send the message back to the original sender
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue,
            body: "Hello from Tact!".asComment(), // comment (optional)
        });
    }
}
```

It's often useful to add the `SendIgnoreErrors{:tact}` flag too, in order to ignore any errors arising while processing this message during the action phase:

```tact
contract Example {
    receive() {
        send(SendParameters {
            // bounce = true by default
            to: sender(), // send the message back to the original sender
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors, // prefer using | over + for the mode
            body: "Hello from Tact!".asComment(), // comment (optional)
        });
    }
}
```

The latter example is identical to using the [`self.reply(){:tact}` function](#how-to-make-a-basic-reply).

## How to send a message with a long text comment

If we need to send a message with a lengthy text comment, we should create a [`String{:tact}`](/book/types#primitive-types) consisting of more than 127 characters. To do this, we can utilize the [`StringBuilder{:tact}`](/book/types#primitive-types) primitive type and its methods `beginComment(){:tact}` and `append(){:tact}`. Prior to sending, we should convert this string into a cell using the `toCell(){:tact}` method.

```tact
contract Example {
    receive() {
        let comment: StringBuilder = beginComment();
        let longString = "..."; // Some string with more than 127 characters.
        comment.append(longString);

        send(SendParameters {
            // bounce = true by default
            to: sender(),
            value: 0,
            mode: SendIgnoreErrors,
            body: comment.toCell(),
        });
    }
}
```

## How to commit the state for the sequence number

To prevent the possibility of replay attacks, you can use unique identifiers, such as `seqno`. Yet, the changes made to it must persist. To do so, the [`commit(){:tact}`](/ref/core-contextstate#commit) function is used.

```tact {20}
message MsgWithSignedData {
    bundle: SignedBundle;
    seqno: Int as uint64;
    someExtraData: Cell;
}

contract Sample(
    publicKey: Int as uint256,
    seqno: Int as uint64,
) {
    external(msg: MsgWithSignedData) {
        // Various checks with accepting the external message processing afterwards
        require(msg.bundle.verifySignature(self.publicKey), "Invalid signature");
        require(msg.seqno == self.seqno, "Invalid seqno");
        acceptMessage();

        // Since we have done all the checks we can now safely increase the number,
        // then commit the state of persistent data and output actions,
        // and, finally, save that state early, before any further actions take place.
        self.seqno += 1;
        commit();
        setData(self.toCell());

        // And now you can safely do something with the rest of the message,
        // knowing that the `self.seqno` change will not be reverted in case of errors
        throw(42); // this will prevent subsequent code from executing,
        //            but will not fail the transaction!
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}

asm fun setData(data: Cell) { c4 POP }
```
