This page lists examples of communication of a single deployed contract with other contracts on blockchain.

For examples of communication between multiple deployed contracts see: [Multi-contract communication](/cookbook/multi-communication).

## How to make a basic reply

```tact
contract Example {
    receive() {
        self.reply("Hello, World!".asComment()); // asComment converts a String to a Cell with a comment
    }
}
```

## How to send a simple message

```tact
contract Example {
    receive() {
        send(SendParameters{
            bounce: true, // default
            to: sender(), // or another destination address
            value: ton("0.01"), // attached amount of Tons to send
            body: "Hello from Tact!".asComment(), // comment (optional)
        });
    }
}
```

## How to send a message with the entire balance

If we need to send the whole balance of the smart contract, then we should use the `SendRemainingBalance{:tact}` send mode. Alternatively, we can use `mode: 128{:tact}`, which has the same meaning.

```tact
contract Example {
    receive() {
        send(SendParameters{
            // bounce = true by default
            to: sender(), // send the message back to the original sender
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingBalance, // or mode: 128
            body: "Hello from Tact!".asComment(), // comment (optional)
        });
    }
}
```

## How to send a message with the remaining value

If we want to make a reply to the same sender, we can use the mode `SendRemainingValue{:tact}` (i.e. `mode: 64{:tact}`), which carries all the remaining value of the inbound message in addition to the value initially indicated in the new message.

```tact
contract Example {
    receive() {
        send(SendParameters{
            // bounce = true by default
            to: sender(), // send the message back to the original sender
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue,
            body: "Hello from Tact!".asComment(), // comment (optional)
        });
    }
}
```

It's often useful to add the `SendIgnoreErrors{:tact}` flag too, in order to ignore any errors arising while processing this message during the action phaseL

```tact
contract Example {
    receive() {
        send(SendParameters{
            // bounce = true by default
            to: sender(), // send the message back to the original sender
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors, // prefer using | over + for the mode
            body: "Hello from Tact!".asComment(), // comment (optional)
        });
    }
}
```

The latter example is identical to using a [`.reply(){:tact}` function](#how-to-make-a-basic-reply).

## How to send a message with a long text comment

If we need to send a message with a lengthy text comment, we should create a [`String{:tact}`](/book/types#primitive-types) that consists of more than $127$ characters. To do this, we can utilize the [`StringBuilder{:tact}`](/book/types#primitive-types) primitive type and its methods called `beginComment(){:tact}` and `append(){:tact}`. Prior to sending, we should convert this string into a cell using the `toCell(){:tact}` method.

```tact
contract Example {
    receive() {
        let comment: StringBuilder = beginComment();
        let longString = "..."; // Some string with more than 127 characters.
        comment.append(longString);

        send(SendParameters{
            // bounce = true by default
            to: sender(),
            value: 0,
            mode: SendIgnoreErrors,
            body: comment.toCell(),
        });
    }
}
```
