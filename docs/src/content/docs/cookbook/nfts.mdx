This page lists common examples of working with [NFTs](https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/asset-processing/nfts).

## Accepting NFT ownership assignment

Notification message of assigned NFT ownership has the following structure:

```tact
message(0x05138d91) NFTOwnershipAssigned {
    previousOwner: Address;
    forwardPayload: Slice as remaining;
}
```

Use [receiver](/book/receive) function to accept notification message.

:::caution

  Sender of notification must be validated!

:::

Validation can be done in two ways:

1. Directly store the NFT item address and validate against it.

```tact
import "@stdlib/deploy";

message(0x05138d91) NFTOwnershipAssigned {
    previousOwner: Address;
    forwardPayload: Slice as remaining;
}

contract SingleNft with Deployable {
    nftItemAddress: Address;

    init(nftItemAddress: Address) {
        self.nftItemAddress = nftItemAddress;
    }

    receive(msg: NFTOwnershipAssigned) {
        require(self.nftItemAddress == sender(), "NFT contract is not the sender");

        // your logic of processing nft ownership assign notification
    }
}
```

2. Use [`StateInit{:tact}`](/book/expressions#initof) and derived address of the NFT item.

```tact
import "@stdlib/deploy";

message(0x05138d91) NFTOwnershipAssigned {
    previousOwner: Address;
    forwardPayload: Slice as remaining;
}

struct NFTItemInitData {
    index: Int as uint64;
    collectionAddress: Address;
}

inline fun calculateNFTAddress(index: Int, collectionAddress: Address, nftCode: Cell): Address {
    let initData = NFTItemInitData{
        index,
        collectionAddress,
    };

    return contractAddress(StateInit{code: nftCode, data: initData.toCell()});
}

contract NftInCollection with Deployable {
    nftCollectionAddress: Address;
    nftItemIndex: Int as uint64;
    nftCode: Cell;

    init(nftCollectionAddress: Address, nftItemIndex: Int, nftCode: Cell) {
        self.nftCollectionAddress = nftCollectionAddress;
        self.nftItemIndex = nftItemIndex;
        self.nftCode = nftCode;
    }

    receive(msg: NFTOwnershipAssigned) {
        let expectedNftAddress = calculateNFTAddress(self.nftItemIndex, self.nftCollectionAddress, self.nftCode); // or you can even store expectedNftAddress
        require(expectedNftAddress == sender(), "NFT contract is not the sender");

        // your logic of processing nft ownership assign notification
    }
}
```

Since the initial data layout of the NFT item can vary, the first approach is often more suitable.

## Transferring NFT item

To send NFT item transfer use [`send(){:tact}`](/book/send) function.

```tact
import "@stdlib/deploy";

message(0x5fcc3d14) NFTTransfer {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    newOwner: Address; // address of the new owner of the NFT item.
    responseDestination: Address; // address where to send a response with confirmation of a successful transfer and the rest of the incoming message coins.
    customPayload: Cell? = null; //  optional custom data. In most cases should be null
    forwardAmount: Int as coins; // the amount of nanotons to be sent to the new owner.
    forwardPayload: Slice as remaining; // optional custom data that should be sent to the new owner.
}

contract Example {
    nftItemAddress: Address;

    init(nftItemAddress: Address) {
        self.nftItemAddress = nftItemAddress;
    }

    // ... add more code from previous examples ...

    receive("transfer") {
        send(SendParameters{
            to: self.nftItemAddress,
            value: ton("0.1"),
            body: NFTTransfer{
                queryId: 42,
                // FIXME: Change this according to your needs
                newOwner: sender(),
                responseDestination: myAddress(),
                customPayload: null,
                forwardAmount: 1,
                forwardPayload: rawSlice("F"), // precomputed beginCell().storeUint(0xF, 4).endCell().beginParse()
            }.toCell(),
        });
    }
}
```

## Get NFT static info

Note, that TON Blockchain does not allow contracts to call each other [getters](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts#getter-functions).
In order to receive data from another contract, you must exchange messages.

```tact
message(0x2fcb26a2) NFTGetStaticData {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
}

message(0x8b771735) NFTReportStaticData {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    index: Int as uint256;
    collection: Address;
}

struct NFTItemInitData {
    index: Int as uint64;
    collectionAddress: Address;
}

inline fun calculateNFTAddress(index: Int, collectionAddress: Address, nftCode: Cell): Address {
    let initData = NFTItemInitData{
        index,
        collectionAddress,
    };

    return contractAddress(StateInit{code: nftCode, data: initData.toCell()});
}

contract Example {
    nftCollectionAddress: Address;
    nftItemIndex: Int as uint64;
    nftCode: Cell;

    init(nftCollectionAddress: Address, nftItemIndex: Int, nftCode: Cell) {
        self.nftCollectionAddress = nftCollectionAddress;
        self.nftItemIndex = nftItemIndex;
        self.nftCode = nftCode;
    }

    // ... add more code from previous examples ...

    receive("get static data") {
        // FIXME: Put proper address("[NFT_ADDRESS]") here
        let nftAddress = sender();
        send(SendParameters{
            to: nftAddress,
            value: ton("0.1"),
            body: NFTGetStaticData{
                queryId: 42,
            }.toCell(),
        });
    }

    receive(msg: NFTReportStaticData) {
        let expectedNftAddress = calculateNFTAddress(msg.index, msg.collection, self.nftCode);
        require(expectedNftAddress == sender(), "NFT contract is not the sender");

        // Save nft static data or do something
    }
}
```

## Get NFT royalty params

NFT royalty params are described [here](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0066-nft-royalty-standard.md).

```tact
message(0x693d3950) NFTGetRoyaltyParams {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
}

message(0xa8cb00ad) NFTReportRoyaltyParams {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    numerator: Int as uint16;
    denominator: Int as uint16;
    destination: Address;
}

contract Example {
    nftCollectionAddress: Address;

    init(nftCollectionAddress: Address) {
        self.nftCollectionAddress = nftCollectionAddress;
    }

    // ... add more code from previous examples ...

    receive("get royalty params") {
        send(SendParameters{
            to: self.nftCollectionAddress,
            value: ton("0.1"),
            body: NFTGetRoyaltyParams{
                queryId: 42,
            }.toCell(),
        });
    }

    receive(msg: NFTReportRoyaltyParams) {
        require(self.nftCollectionAddress == sender(), "NFT collection contract is not the sender");

        // Do something with msg
    }
}
```

## NFT Collection methods


:::caution

  These methods are not part of any standard, and they will only work with [this specific implementation](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/nft/nft-collection.fc). Please keep this in mind before using them.

:::

Note that only NFT owners are allowed to use these methods.

### Deploy NFT

```tact
message(0x1) NFTDeploy {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    itemIndex: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as coins; // amount to sent when deploying nft
    nftContent: Cell;
}

contract Example {
    nftCollectionAddress: Address;

    init(nftCollectionAddress: Address) {
        self.nftCollectionAddress = nftCollectionAddress;
    }

    // ... add more code from previous examples ...

    receive("deploy") {
        send(SendParameters{
            to: self.nftCollectionAddress,
            value: ton("0.14"),
            body: NFTDeploy{
                queryId: 42,
                itemIndex: 42,
                amount: ton("0.1"),
                nftContent: beginCell().endCell() // FIXME: Should be your content, mostly generated offchain
            }.toCell(),
        });
    }
}
```

### Change owner

```tact
message(0x3) NFTChangeOwner {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    newOwner: Address;
}

contract Example {
    nftCollectionAddress: Address;

    init(nftCollectionAddress: Address) {
        self.nftCollectionAddress = nftCollectionAddress;
    }

    // ... add more code from previous examples ...

    receive("change owner") {
        send(SendParameters{
            to: self.nftCollectionAddress,
            value: ton("0.05"),
            body: NFTChangeOwner{
                queryId: 42,
                // FIXME: Put proper address("NEW_OWNER_ADDRESS") here
                newOwner: sender(),
            }.toCell(),
        });
    }
}
```
