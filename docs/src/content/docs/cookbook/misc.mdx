## How to throw errors

The `throw(){:tact}` function in a contract is useful when we don't know how often to perform a specific action.

It allows intentional exception or error handling, which leads to the termination of the current transaction and reverts any state changes made during that transaction.

```tact
let number: Int = 198;

// the error will be triggered anyway
throw(36);

// the error will be triggered only if the number is greater than 50
nativeThrowIf(35, number > 50);

// the error will be triggered only if the number is NOT EQUAL to 198
nativeThrowUnless(39, number == 198);
```
