## How to throw errors

The `throw(){:tact}` function in a contract is useful when we don't know how often to perform a specific action.

It allows intentional exception or error handling, which leads to the termination of the current transaction and reverts any state changes made during that transaction.

```tact
let number: Int = 198;

// the error will be triggered anyway
try { throw(36); } catch (exitCode) {}

// the error will be triggered only if the number is greater than 50
try { nativeThrowIf(35, number > 50); } catch (exitCode) {}

// the error will be triggered only if the number is NOT EQUAL to 198
try { nativeThrowUnless(39, number == 198); } catch (exitCode) {}
```
