# DeDust.io


[DeDust](https://dedust.io) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) built natively on [TON Blockchain](https://ton.org) and [DeDust Protocol 2.0](https://docs.dedust.io/reference/tlb-schemes). DeDust is designed with a meticulous attention to user experience (UX), gas efficiency, and extensibility.

## Swaps

You can read more about swaps on [DeDust documentation](https://docs.dedust.io/docs/swaps).

:::warning

  It's important to ensure that contracts are deployed.
  Sending funds to an inactive contract could result in irretrievable loss.

:::

All kinds of swaps shares same structures:

```tact
struct SwapStep {
    poolAddress: Address;
    reserved: Cell? = null; // NULL always, reserved.
    limit: Int as coins = 0;
    nextStep: Cell?; // should be `SwapStep`, but recursive types not supported in tact
}

struct SwapParams {
    deadline: Int as uint32 = 0;
    recipientAddress: Address? = null;
    referralAddress: Address? = null;
    fulfillPayload: Cell? = null;
    rejectPayload: Cell? = null;
}
```

### Swapping native coin

```tact
message(0xea06185d) NativeSwap {
    queryId: Int as uint64 = 0;
    amount: Int as coins; // TON amount for the swap
    poolAddress: Address;
    reserved: Cell? = null; // NULL always, reserved.
    limit: Int as coins = 0;
    nextStep: SwapStep? = null;
    swapParams: SwapParams;
}

// address of ton vault to send message
const TON_VAULT_ADDRESS: Address = address("EQDa4VOnTYlLvDJ0gZjNYm5PXfSmmtL6Vs6A_CZEtXCNICq_");

// address of pool to swap. Pool is pair like TON/USDT
const POOL_ADDRESS: Address = address("EQCY5ufIEA-wdv1L5Zw09OMDHywwHsqLKEAUBYtngwNnnal4");

const TON_SWAP_GAS_AMOUNT: Int = ton("0.2");

fun makeTonSwap() {
    let swapParams = SwapParams{
        deadline: 0,
        recipientAddress: null,
        referralAddress: null,
        fulfillPayload: null,
        rejectPayload: null,
    };

    // ton amount to swap in nanotons
    let swapAmount = ...;

    send(SendParameters{
        to: TON_VAULT_ADDRESS,
        value: swapAmount + TON_SWAP_GAS_AMOUNT,
        body: NativeSwap{
            queryId: 0,
            amount: swapAmount,
            poolAddress: POOL_ADDRESS,
            reserved: null,
            limit: 0,
            nextStep: null,
            swapParams,
        }.toCell()
    });
}
```


### Swapping jetton

```tact
message(0xf8a7ea5) TokenTransfer {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as coins;
    destination: Address;
    responseDestination: Address;
    customPayload: Cell?;
    forwardTonAmount: Int as coins;
    forwardPayload: Cell?;
}

message(0xe3a0d482) JettonSwapPayload {
    poolAddress: Address;
    reserved: Cell? = null; // NULL always, reserved.
    limit: Int as coins = 0;
    nextStep: SwapStep? = null;
    swapParams: SwapParams;
}

// address of jetton master you want to swap
const JETTON_MASTER_ADDRESS: Address = address("kQCxBOJjV31OIAa0NN9JbaYUp6OXOahcFCipuYnsujx1MDAY");

// address of jetton vault to send message
const JETTON_VAULT_ADDRESS: Address = address("EQCgne1aW1CmkokSeRjMIREmJWbCKFbJxxkRCvtLDiheTTF9");

// address of pool to swap. Pool is pair like TON/USDT
const POOL_ADDRESS: Address = address("EQCY5ufIEA-wdv1L5Zw09OMDHywwHsqLKEAUBYtngwNnnal4");

const JETTON_SWAP_GAS_AMOUNT: Int = ton("0.3");
const JETTON_SWAP_FWD_AMOUNT: Int = ton("0.25");

fun makeJettonSwap() {
    let swapParams = SwapParams{
        deadline: 0,
        recipientAddress: null,
        referralAddress: null,
        fulfillPayload: null,
        rejectPayload: null,
    };

    let myJettonWalletAddress = ...; // calculate wallet address of jetton you want to swap
    let swapAmount = ...; // jetton amount for swap

    send(SendParameters{
        to: myJettonWalletAddress,
        value: JETTON_SWAP_GAS_AMOUNT,
        body: TokenTransfer{
            queryId: 0,
            amount: swapAmount,
            destination: JETTON_VAULT_ADDRESS,
            responseDestination: myAddress(),
            customPayload: null,
            forwardTonAmount: JETTON_SWAP_FWD_AMOUNT,
            forwardPayload: JettonSwapPayload{
                poolAddress: POOL_ADDRESS,
                reserved: null,
                limit: 0,
                nextStep: null,
                swapParams,
            }.toCell()
        }.toCell()
    });
}
```
