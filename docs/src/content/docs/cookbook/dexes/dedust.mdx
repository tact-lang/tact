[DeDust](https://dedust.io) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) built natively on [TON Blockchain](https://ton.org) and [DeDust Protocol 2.0](https://docs.dedust.io/reference/tlb-schemes). DeDust is designed with a meticulous attention to user experience (UX), gas efficiency, and extensibility.

Before going further, familiarize yourself with the following:

* [Sending messages](/book/send/)
* [Fungible Tokens (Jettons)](/cookbook/jettons/)

## Swaps

Read more about swaps in the [DeDust documentation](https://docs.dedust.io/docs/swaps).

:::caution

  It's important to ensure that contracts are deployed. Sending funds to an inactive contract could result in irretrievable loss.

:::

All kinds of swaps use `SwapStep{:tact}` and `SwapParams{:tact}` structures:

```tact
/// https://docs.dedust.io/reference/tlb-schemes#swapstep
struct SwapStep {
    // The pool that will do the swapping, i.e. pairs like TON/USDT or USDT/DUST
    poolAddress: Address;

    // A kind of swap to make, can only be 0 as of now
    kind: Int as uint1 = 0;

    // Minimum output of the swap
    // If the actual value is less than specified, the swap will be rejected
    limit: Int as coins = 0;

    // Reference to the next step, which can be used for multi-hop swaps
    // The type here is actually `SwapStep?`,
    // but specifying recursive types isn't allowed in Tact yet
    nextStep: Cell?;
}

/// https://docs.dedust.io/reference/tlb-schemes#swapparams
struct SwapParams {
    // Specifies a deadline for the swap to reject the swap coming to the pool late
    // Accepts the number of seconds passed since the UNIX Epoch
    // Defaults to 0, which removes the deadline
    deadline: Int as uint32 = 0;

    // Specifies an address where funds will be sent after the swap
    // Defaults to `null`, which makes the swap use the sender's address
    recipientAddress: Address? = null;

    // Referral address, required for the referral program of DeDust
    // Defaults to `null`
    referralAddress: Address? = null;

    // Custom payload that will be attached to the fund transfer upon a successful swap
    // Defaults to `null`
    fulfillPayload: Cell? = null;

    // Custom payload that will be attached to the fund transfer upon a rejected swap
    // Defaults to `null`
    rejectPayload: Cell? = null;
}
```

### Swap Toncoin for any Jetton

:::note
The guides below use the [Jetton vault](https://docs.dedust.io/docs/concepts#vault). To obtain its address for your Jetton, refer to [this guide](https://docs.dedust.io/docs/swaps#step-1-find-the-vault-scale).

    // Set of parameters relevant for the whole swap
    swapParams: SwapParams;
}

// Let's say `swapAmount` is `ton("0.1")`, which is 10000000 nanoToncoins
fun swapToncoinForUSDT(swapAmount: Int) {
    send(SendParameters{
        // Address of TON vault to send the message to
        to: address("EQDa4VOnTYlLvDJ0gZjNYm5PXfSmmtL6Vs6A_CZEtXCNICq_"),
        // Amount to swap plus a trade fee
        value: swapAmount + ton("0.2"),
        body: NativeSwap{

## Liquidity Provisioning

To provide liquidity to a particular DeDust pool, you must provide both assets. The pool will then issue special _LP tokens_ to the depositor's address.

Read more about liquidity provisioning in the [DeDust documentation](https://docs.dedust.io/docs/liquidity-provisioning).

```tact

### Withdraw liquidity

To withdraw liquidity, burning LP tokens is required. You can refer to examples of Jetton burning in the [respective section of Jettons Cookbook page](/cookbook/jettons#burning-jetton). However, more Toncoins should be added than for the normal burn, since adding too few may result in LP tokens being burned, but no (or only partial) liquidity being sent from the pool. Therefore, consider attaching at least $0.5$ Toncoin — excess amount will be returned.
