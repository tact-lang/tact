# STON.fi

[STON.fi](https://ston.fi) is a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) built on [TON blockchain](https://ton.org) providing virtually zero fees, low slippage, an extremely easy interface, and direct integration with TON wallets.

:::caution

  The examples on this page use STON.fi's API v2, which is currently under development. Thus, all addresses are given in [testnet][testnet].

  Proceed with caution and vigilance â€” do not attempt to send funds from the mainnet to the testnet and vice versa.

:::

Before going further, familiarize yourself with the following:

* [Receiving messages](/book/receive/)
* [Sending messages](/book/send/)
* [Fungible Tokens (Jettons)](/cookbook/jettons/)
* [STON.fi Docs: Glossary](https://docs.ston.fi/docs/user-section/glossary)
* [STON.fi Docs: Architecture](https://docs.ston.fi/docs/developer-section/architecture)

## Swaps

Read more about swaps in the [STON.fi documentation](https://docs.ston.fi/docs/developer-section/api-reference-v2/example_swap).

Swaps use `StonfiSwap{:tact}` [Message][message] and `SwapAdditionalData{:tact}` [Struct][struct]:

```tact
/// https://docs.ston.fi/docs/developer-section/api-reference-v2/router#swap-0x6664de2a
message(0x6664de2a) StonfiSwap {
    // Address of the other Router token wallet
    otherTokenWallet: Address;

    // Where to send refunds upon a failed swap
    refundAddress: Address;

    // Where to send excesses upon a successful swap
    excessesAddress: Address;

    // UNIX timestamp of execution deadline for the swap
    deadline: Int as uint64;

    // Reference to another Cell with additional data,
    // using the Tact's greedy auto-layout mechanism
    additionalData: SwapAdditionalData;
}

/// https://docs.ston.fi/docs/developer-section/api-reference-v2/router#additional_data-body
struct SwapAdditionalData {
    // Minimum required amount of tokens to receive
    // Defaults to 1, which causes the swap to fail
    //                only if no tokens are received
    minOut: Int as coins = 1;

    // Where to send tokens upon a successful swap
    receiverAddress: Address;

    // Forward fees for the `customPayload` if it's not `null`
    // Defaults to 0
    fwdGas: Int as coins = 0;

    // Custom payload that will be sent upon a successful swap
    // Defaults to `null`, which means no payload
    customPayload: Cell? = null;

    // Forward fees for `refundPayload` if it's not `null`
    // Defaults to 0
    refundFwdGas: Int as coins = 0;

    // Custom payload that will be sent upon a failed swap
    // Defaults to `null`, which means no payload
    refundPayload: Cell? = null;

    // Referral fee, between 0 (no fee) and 100 (1%)
    // Defaults to 10, which means 0.1% fee
    refFee: Int as uint16 = 10;

    // Address of the referral
    // Defaults to `null`
    referralAddress: Address? = null;
}
```

The [STON.fi SDK](https://github.com/ston-fi/sdk) defines some [constants to deal with fees](https://github.com/ston-fi/sdk/blob/786ece758794bd5c575db8b38f5e5de19f43f0d1/packages/sdk/src/contracts/dex/v2_1/router/BaseRouterV2_1.ts). Note that these are hardcoded values, but the best practice is to [calculate fees dynamically using current config params](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/fee-calculation) instead.

```tact
/// Hardcoded fee value to pay for sending a message to the Jetton wallet
const FeeSwapJettonToJetton: Int = ton("0.3");
/// Hardcoded fee value to pay forward fees from the Jetton wallet
const FeeSwapJettonToJettonFwd: Int = ton("0.24");

/// Hardcoded fee value to pay for sending a message to the Jetton wallet
const FeeSwapJettonToToncoin: Int = ton("0.3");
/// Hardcoded fee value to pay for sending a message to the Jetton wallet
const FeeSwapJettonToToncoinFwd: Int = ton("0.24");

/// Hardcoded fee value to pay for sending a message and subsequent forwarding
const FeeSwapToncoinToJetton: Int = ton("0.01") + ton("0.3");
```

### Toncoin to Jetton {#swaps-jetton-to-toncoin}

To swap Toncoin to Jetton, STON.fi requires the use of a so-called proxy Toncoin wallet (or pTON for short). To interact with it properly, we need to introduce a `ProxyToncoinTransfer{:tact}` [Message][message]:

```tact
/// https://github.com/ston-fi/sdk/blob/786ece758794bd5c575db8b38f5e5de19f43f0d1/packages/sdk/src/contracts/pTON/v2_1/PtonV2_1.ts
message(0x01f3835d) ProxyToncoinTransfer {
    // Unique identifier used to trace transactions across multiple contracts
    // Defaults to 0, which means we don't mark messages to trace their chains
    queryId: Int as uint64 = 0;

    // Toncoin amount for the swap
    tonAmount: Int as coins;

    // Where to send refunds upon a failed swap
    refundAddress: Address;

    // Optional custom payload to attach to the swap
    // Defaults to `null`
    forwardPayload: Cell?;
}
```

Notice that `ProxyToncoinTransfer{:tact}` is quite similar to `JettonTransfer{:tact}`, except that it doesn't require any addresses other than the refund address, nor does it require any forward amounts to be specified.

:::caution

  The following example uses STON.fi's API v2, which is currently under development. Thus, all addresses are given in [testnet][testnet].

  In addition, some variables such as `offerAmount` are hardcoded for demonstration purposes. Don't forget to change them in real life scenarios.

```tact

    = address("kQBbJjnahBMGbMUJwhAXLn8BiigcGXMJhSC0l7DBhdYABhG7");

const RouterJettonWallet: Address =
    address("kQAtX3x2s-wMtYTz8CfmAyloHAB73vONzJM5S2idqXl-_5xK");

fun toncoinToJetton() {
    // Amount of Toncoin to swap
    let offerAmount: Int = 1_000;

    // Prepare the payload
    let forwardPayload = StonfiSwap{
        otherTokenWallet: RouterJettonWallet,
        refundAddress: myAddress(),

## Liquidity provision

Read more about liquidity provision in the [STON.fi documentation](https://docs.ston.fi/docs/developer-section/api-reference-v2/example_lp_provide).

STON.fi allows you to deposit liquidity by specifying only one type of token - the pool will automatically perform the swap and mint liquidity provider (LP) tokens. To do this you need to set `bothPositive` field of `ProvideLiquidity{:tact}` [Message][message] to `false{:tact}`.

Liquidity deposits use `ProvideLiquidity{:tact}` [Message][message] and `ProvideLiqudityAdditionalData{:tact}` [Struct][struct]:

```tact
/// https://docs.ston.fi/docs/developer-section/api-reference-v2/router#provide_lp-0x37c096df
message(0x37c096df) ProvideLiquidity {
    // Address of the other Router token wallet
    otherTokenWallet: Address;

    // Where to send refunds if provisioning fails
    refundAddress: Address;

    // Where to send excesses if provisioning succeeds
    excessesAddress: Address;

    // UNIX timestamp of execution deadline for the provisioning
    deadline: Int as uint64;

    // Reference to another Cell with additional data,
    // using the Tact's greedy auto-layout mechanism
    additionalData: ProvideLiquidityAdditionalData;
}

/// https://docs.ston.fi/docs/developer-section/api-reference-v2/router#additional_data-body-1
struct ProvideLiquidityAdditionalData {
    // Minimum required amount of LP tokens to receive
    // Defaults to 1, which causes the provisioning to fail
    //                only if no tokens are received
    minLpOut: Int as coins = 1;

    // Where to send LP tokens if provisioning succeeds
    receiverAddress: Address;

    // Should both tokens in a pair have a positive quantity?
    // If not, then the pool would perform an additional swap for the lacking token
    // Defaults to `true`, which means that deposit would only go through
    //                     when both token amounts are non-zero
    bothPositive: Bool = true;

    // Forward fees for the `customPayload` if it's not `null`
    // Defaults to 0
    fwdGas: Int as coins = 0;

    // Custom payload that will be sent if provisioning succeeds
    // Defaults to `null`, which means no payload
    customPayload: Cell? = null;
}
```

The [STON.fi SDK](https://github.com/ston-fi/sdk) defines some [constants to deal with fees](https://github.com/ston-fi/sdk/blob/786ece758794bd5c575db8b38f5e5de19f43f0d1/packages/sdk/src/contracts/dex/v2_1/router/BaseRouterV2_1.ts). Note that these are hardcoded values, but the best practice is to [calculate fees dynamically using current config params](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/fee-calculation) instead.

```tact
/// Hardcoded fee value to pay for sending a liquidity provisioning message
/// when depositing a certain amount of Jettons
const FeeSingleSideProvideLpJetton: Int = ton("1");

/// Hardcoded fee value to pay forward fees of subsequent messages for liquidity provisioning
const FeeSingleSideProvideLpJettonFwd: Int = ton("0.8");

/// Hardcoded fee value to pay for sending a liquidity provisioning message
/// when depositing a certain amount of Toncoins
const FeeSingleSideProvideLpToncoin: Int = ton("0.01") + ton("0.8");
```

### Withdraw liquidity

To withdraw liquidity, burning LP tokens is required. You can refer to examples of Jetton burning in the [respective section of Jettons Cookbook page](/cookbook/jettons#burning-jetton). However, more Toncoins should be added than for the normal burn, since adding too few may result in LP tokens being burned, but no (or only partial) liquidity being sent from the pool. Therefore, consider attaching at least $0.5$ Toncoin â€” excess amount will be returned.
