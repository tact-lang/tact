This page lists examples of working with random numbers, uncertainty and randomness in general.

## How to generate a random number

```tact
// Declare a variable to store the random number
let number: Int;

// Generate a new random number, which is an unsigned 256-bit integer
number = randomInt();

// Generate a random number between 1 and 12
number = random(1, 12);
```
