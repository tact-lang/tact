The main reason for making the Tact Cookbook is to gather all the experiences of Tact developers in one place so that future developers can use it. This section of the documentation is more focused on everyday tasks that every Tact developer resolves during the development of smart contracts.

Use it as a recipe book for cooking up delightful smart contracts on TON Blockchain without re-inventing the wheel in the process.

<Steps>

1. #### Single contract {#single-contract}

   Following pages focus on single-contract examples and cover a wide range of topics:

   <CardGrid>
    <LinkCard
      title="1️⃣ Single-contract communication"
      href="/cookbook/single-communication"
    />
    <LinkCard
      title="⚙️ Type conversion"
      href="/cookbook/type-conversion"
    />
    <LinkCard
      title="📦 Data structures"
      href="/cookbook/data-structures"
    />
    <LinkCard
      title="🤖 Algorithms"
      href="/cookbook/algo"
    />
    <LinkCard
      title="📆 Time and date"
      href="/cookbook/time"
    />
    <LinkCard
      title="⚠️ Access control"
      href="/cookbook/access"
    />
    <LinkCard
      title="✨ Randomness"
      href="/cookbook/random"
    />
    <LinkCard
      title="🤔 Miscellaneous"
      href="/cookbook/misc"
    />
   </CardGrid>

2. #### Multiple contracts {#multiple-contracts}

   Following pages focus on multi-contract examples, exploring the scalable nature of TON Blockchain:

   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="🧮 Multi-contract communication"
       href="/cookbook/multi-communication"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="💎 Fungible Tokens (Jettons)"
       href="/cookbook/jettons"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="🖼️ Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)"
       href="/cookbook/nfts"
     />
   </CardGrid>

   Additionally, there are examples of working with popular TON DEXes (Decentralized EXchanges), which often require many contracts and complex logic:

   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="DeDust.io"
       href="/cookbook/dexes/dedust"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="STON.fi"
       href="/cookbook/dexes/stonfi"
     />
   </CardGrid>

</Steps>
