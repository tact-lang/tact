The main reason for creating the Tact Cookbook is to gather all the experiences of Tact developers in one place so that future developers can use it. This section of the documentation focuses on everyday tasks that every Tact developer resolves during the development of smart contracts.

Use it as a recipe book for cooking up delightful smart contracts on TON Blockchain without reinventing the wheel in the process.

For DeFi-specific elaborate recipes that include smart contracts, auxiliary scripts, and testing suites, see the [Tact's DeFi Cookbook on GitHub](https://github.com/tact-lang/defi-cookbook).

<Steps>

1. #### Single contract {#single-contract}

   The following pages focus on single-contract examples and cover a wide range of topics:

   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="1️⃣ Single-contract communication"
       href="/cookbook/single-communication"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="⚙️ Type conversion"
       href="/cookbook/type-conversion"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="📦 Data structures"
       href="/cookbook/data-structures"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="🤖 Algorithms"
       href="/cookbook/algo"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="📆 Time and date"
       href="/cookbook/time"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="⚠️ Access control"
       href="/cookbook/access"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="✨ Randomness"
       href="/cookbook/random"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="🔄 Code upgrades"
       href="/cookbook/upgrades"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="🤔 Miscellaneous"
       href="/cookbook/misc"
     />
   </CardGrid>

2. #### Multiple contracts {#multiple-contracts}

   The following pages focus on multi-contract examples, exploring the scalable nature of TON Blockchain:

   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="🧮 Multi-contract communication"
       href="/cookbook/multi-communication"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="💎 Fungible Tokens (Jettons)"
       href="/cookbook/jettons"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="🖼️ Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)"
       href="/cookbook/nfts"
     />
   </CardGrid>

   Additionally, there are examples of working with popular TON DEXes (Decentralized EXchanges), which often require many contracts and complex logic:

   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="DeDust.io"
       href="/cookbook/dexes/dedust"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="STON.fi"
       href="/cookbook/dexes/stonfi"
     />
   </CardGrid>

3. #### DeFi Cookbook on GitHub {#defi-cookbook}

   As an extension of this Cookbook, we've made a special GitHub repository for elaborate recipes that include smart contracts, auxiliary scripts, and testing suites. Here are some of the recipes of the [Tact's DeFi Cookbook on GitHub](https://github.com/tact-lang/defi-cookbook):

   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="Receive Jettons"
       href="https://github.com/tact-lang/defi-cookbook/tree/main/jettons/receive-jettons"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="Receive USDT"
       href="https://github.com/tact-lang/defi-cookbook/tree/main/jettons/receive-usdt"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="Send Jettons"
       href="https://github.com/tact-lang/defi-cookbook/tree/main/jettons/send-jettons"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="Send USDT"
       href="https://github.com/tact-lang/defi-cookbook/tree/main/jettons/send-usdt"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="Mint USDT"
       href="https://github.com/tact-lang/defi-cookbook/tree/main/jettons/mint-usdt"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="Onchain API"
       href="https://github.com/tact-lang/defi-cookbook/tree/main/jettons/onchain-api"
     />
   </CardGrid>
