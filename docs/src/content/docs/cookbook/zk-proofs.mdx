## Introduction

This guide shows how to create, compile, and test Circom circuits and verify **ZK-proofs** on **TON Blockchain** using the **Tact** language and the **zk-SNARK Groth16** protocol.

It demonstrates how to use the **[zkJetton](https://github.com/zkTokenTip/zkJetton)** repository to create a Jetton token in the TON blockchain, where user balances are hidden using homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs.

The zkJetton project combines the Jetton standard with ZK-proof verification inside Tact smart contracts. `zkJetton` is based on the pipeline **Circom → snarkjs → export-ton-verifier → Tact**, similar to the examples from [zk-ton-example](https://github.com/zkTokenTip/zk-ton-example).

:::note

  This guide is also applicable to circuits written in [Noname](https://github.com/zksecurity/noname), since the `export-ton-verifier` library integrates with `snarkjs`, which in turn supports Noname.

  You can also use [gnark](https://github.com/Consensys/gnark) circuits by importing a verification key compatible with `snarkjs`.

### Disclaimer

This repository uses a simplified version of Jetton written in Tact. The code has not been audited, contains potential vulnerabilities, and requires significant improvements. It is implemented solely for educational purposes.

### What this guide covers

- Setting up the environment.
- How zkJetton is designed.
- How to work with Circom.
- Exporting zk-verifiers for Tact.
- Testing zkJetton.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** LTS version 18 or later installed.
- **[circom](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/#installing-circom)** and [snarkjs](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/#installing-snarkjs) packages installed.
- Basic familiarity with TON, Tact, and the Blueprint toolkit.
- Basic knowledge of [Jettons](/cookbook/jettons).

## Project setup

<Steps>

1. Create a new project with Blueprint:

   ```shell
   npm create ton@latest -- zk-proofs-tact --type tact-empty --contractName ZkProofs
   ```

2. Install libraries for ZK-proof handling:

   ```shell
   npm install snarkjs @types/snarkjs
   ```

3. Install the verifier export utility for TON:

   ```shell
   npm install export-ton-verifier@latest
   ```

   This tool exports verifier contracts for Tact, FunC, and Tolk.

</Steps>

:::note

  Alternatively, clone the finished project and install necessary dependencies:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/zkTokenTip/zkJetton.git
  cd zkJetton
  npm install
  ```

## Homomorphic encryption

This project uses additively homomorphic **Paillier** encryption for private balances. It allows performing **addition** operations directly on encrypted data without decryption:

$$
Enc(m_1) \cdot Enc(m_2) \bmod n^2 = Enc(m_1 + m_2)
$$

This aligns perfectly with Jetton logic: deposit/withdrawal = adding/subtracting to the hidden balance.

## zkJetton architecture

The token consists of several contracts:

1. `ZkJettonMinter` — similar to [`JettonMinter`](/cookbook/jetton-master-contract):
  - The main token contract.
  - Allows minting tokens via the `Mint` message.
  - Inherits from `trait MintVerifier`.
2. `ZkJettonWallet` — similar to [`JettonWallet`](/cookbook/jetton-wallet-contract):
  - Created for each user upon registration. Allows transferring tokens (`ZkJettonTransfer`) and receiving them (`ZkJettonTransferInternal`).
  - Inherits from `trait RegistrationVerifier` and `trait TransferVerifier`.

## Circom

In the `circuits` directory, you will find `circom` circuits that can be compiled as follows:

```shell
cd circuits

circom registration.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym --prime bls12381
circom mint.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym --prime bls12381
circom transfer.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym --prime bls12381
```

Compilation produces:
- `.r1cs` — circuit constraints (R1CS)
- `.sym` — signal mapping
- `.wasm` — artifact for proof generation

:::note
`snarkjs` supports both **altbn-128** and **bls12-381** curves. Ethereum uses altbn-128, but TON uses **bls12-381**, which is why this guide uses it.
:::

### Circuits

#### Registration circuit
The first step is registering in the token contract and assigning the user keys that will be used for encrypting balances.

The template for fast modular exponentiation is imported first:

```
include "binpower.circom";
```

This template is then used to encrypt an initial balance of zero, required for proving that the encrypted balance indeed equals zero.

#### Mint circuit
The second step is minting tokens to the user.

After registration, the user’s public key and encrypted balance are stored in the token contract.

The circuit checks that the minted amount is encrypted with the recipient’s public key. This is important because otherwise, when adding the encrypted balance and transfer amount, the decrypted result could be invalid (e.g., instead of 10 tokens, the user might get 10,000).

#### Transfer circuit
The third step is transferring tokens from one user to another.

The circuit checks that:
1. The transfer amount does not exceed the decrypted user balance.
2. The encrypted transfer amounts for sender and recipient are correctly encrypted with their respective public keys and are valid.

### Trusted setup (Groth16)

After writing and compiling circuits, the next step is running a simplified trusted setup ceremony. Example for the registration circuit (similar for others):

```shell
snarkjs powersoftau new bls12-381 10 pot10_0000.ptau -v
snarkjs powersoftau contribute pot10_0000.ptau pot10_0001.ptau --name="First contribution" -v -e="some random text"
snarkjs powersoftau prepare phase2 pot10_0001.ptau pot10_final.ptau -v
snarkjs groth16 setup registration.r1cs pot10_final.ptau registration_0000.zkey
snarkjs zkey contribute registration_0000.zkey registration_final.zkey --name="1st Contributor Name" -v -e="some random text"

# export verification key
snarkjs zkey export verificationkey registration_final.zkey verification_key.json
```

The parameter (`10`) affects execution time — larger circuits require higher values.

## Exporting verifier contracts

After the trusted setup ceremony, verifier contracts can be exported for Tact:

```shell
npx export-ton-verifier --tact \
    ./circuits/registration/registration_final.zkey \
    ./contracts/verifiers/verifier_registration.tact
```

This generates a contract template that accepts a proof and verifies it:

```tact
contract Verifier() {
    receive(msg: Verify) {
        let res = self.groth16Verify(msg.piA, msg.piB, msg.piC, msg.pubInputs);
    }

    fun groth16Verify(
        piA: Slice,
        piB: Slice,
        piC: Slice,
        pubInputs: map<Int as uint32, Int>
    ): Bool {
        // Body of this utility function was hidden for simplicity purposes
        return true;
    }

    get fun verify(
        piA: Slice,
        piB: Slice,
        piC: Slice,
        pubInputs: map<Int as uint32, Int>
    ): Bool {
        return self.groth16Verify(piA, piB, piC, pubInputs);
    }
}

message Verify {
    piA: Slice;
    piB: Slice;
    piC: Slice;
    pubInputs: map<Int as uint32, Int>;
}
```

For quick checks, you can use the `verify` get-method.

Possible integration approaches:
1. Turn the contract into a `trait` and inherit from it. The most convenient option.
2. Extend the generated contract with business logic.
3. Use a two-step flow:
   - User → Verifier (proof check)
   - Verifier → Main contract (execute logic if verified)

## Testing and proof verification

Testing is split into two stages:
1. Verifier testing (`Verifiers.spec.ts`)
2. Token testing (`zkJetton.spec.ts`)

Helper functions in the `common` directory simplify proof generation.

### Preparing for testing

For example, here is how to prepare the registration:

```ts
// Implementation of the homomorphic cryptosystem
import paillierBigint from 'paillier-bigint';
import * as snarkjs from 'snarkjs';
import path from 'path';

// dictFromInputList — converts input array into a `Dictionary`.
// groth16CompressProof — prepares the proof for sending to the contract.
import { dictFromInputList, groth16CompressProof } from 'export-ton-verifier';

const wasmPath = path.join(__dirname, '../../circuits/registration/registration_js', 'registration.wasm');
const zkeyPath = path.join(__dirname, '../../circuits/registration', 'registration_final.zkey');
```

### Generating a proof

Proofs can be generated in one line:

```ts
await snarkjs.groth16.fullProve(getRegistrationData(keys), wasmPath, zkeyPath);
```

The function `getRegistrationData(keys)` generates input values for proof creation:

```ts
export function getRegistrationData(keys: paillierBigint.KeyPair) {
    const balance = initBalance;   // 0
    const rand_r = getRandomBigInt(keys.publicKey.n);
    const encryptedBalance = keys.publicKey.encrypt(balance, rand_r);
    const pubKey = [keys.publicKey.g, rand_r, keys.publicKey.n];

    return { encryptedBalance, balance, pubKey };
}
```

Which corresponds to this `circom` circuit:

```
signal input encryptedBalance;
signal input balance;
// public key: g, rand r, n
signal input pubKey[3];
```

The generated proof is then prepared for contract submission:

```ts
const { proof, publicSignals } = await createRegistrationProof(keys);

const { pi_a, pi_b, pi_c, pubInputs } = await groth16CompressProof(proof, publicSignals);
```

### Proof verification

For testing, proofs can be verified locally:

```ts
const verificationKey = require('../circuits/verification_key.json');

const ok = await snarkjs.groth16.verify(verificationKey, publicSignals, proof);
```

Or sent to the contract:

```ts
await zkJettonWallet.getVerifyRegistration(
    beginCell().storeBuffer(pi_a).endCell().asSlice(),
    beginCell().storeBuffer(pi_b).endCell().asSlice(),
    beginCell().storeBuffer(pi_c).endCell().asSlice(),
    dictFromInputList(pubInputs),
)
```

## Conclusion

`zkJetton` is a working example of a minimal Jetton token with private balances. It demonstrates:
- how to integrate zk-proofs into TON,
- how to protect user data,
- how to use Circom circuits with Tact contracts.

This can serve as a foundation for building private DeFi protocols, DAOs, or payment systems in TON.
