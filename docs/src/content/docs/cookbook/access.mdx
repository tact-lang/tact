## How to check sender privileges using the Ownable trait

```tact
// Ownable has to be imported from stdlib
import "@stdlib/ownable";

message FooBarMsg {
    newVal: Int as uint32;
}

// Ownable trait can limit certain actions to the owner only
contract SenderChecker with Ownable {
    // Persistent state variables
    owner: Address;     // Ownable trait requires you to add this exact state variable
    val: Int as uint32; // some value

    init() {
        // We can initialize owner to any value we want, the deployer in this case:
        self.owner = sender();
        self.val = 0;
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }

    receive("inc") {
        self.requireOwner(); // Throws exit code 132 if the sender isn't the owner
        self.val += 1;
    }

    receive(msg: FooBarMsg) {
        self.requireOwner(); // Throws exit code 132 if the sender isn't the owner
        self.val = msg.newVal;
    }
}
```
