## 🚀 Let's start! {#start}

<p>ㅤ</p>

<Steps>

1. #### Ensure that the supported version of Node.js is installed and available {#start-1}

	 To check it, run `node --version{:shell}` — it should show you the version 22.0.0 or later.

2. #### Run the following command {#start-2}

   It will create a new project with the simple counter contract:

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="yarn" icon="seti:yarn">
       ```shell
       # recommended
       yarn create ton simple-counter --type tact-counter --contractName SimpleCounter
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">
       ```shell
       npm create ton@latest -- simple-counter --type tact-counter --contractName SimpleCounter
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
       ```shell
       pnpm create ton@latest simple-counter --type tact-counter --contractName SimpleCounter
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="bun" icon="bun">
       ```shell
       bun create ton@latest simple-counter --type tact-counter --contractName SimpleCounter
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. #### That's it! {#start-3}

   Your first contract project is written and compiled already!

   Go check it out by moving into the relevant directory — `cd simple-counter/contracts{:shell}`. Here's how it would look like:

	 ```tact
	 import "@stdlib/deploy";

	 message Add {
	     queryId: Int as uint64;
	     amount: Int as uint32;
	 }

	 contract SimpleCounter with Deployable {
	     id: Int as uint32;
	     counter: Int as uint32;

	     init(id: Int) {
	         self.id = id;
	         self.counter = 0;
	     }

	     receive(msg: Add) {
	         self.counter += msg.amount;

	         // Notify the caller that the receiver was executed and forward remaining value back
	         self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
	     }

	     get fun counter(): Int {
	         return self.counter;
	     }

	     get fun id(): Int {
	         return self.id;
	     }
	 }
	 ```

   To re-compile or deploy, refer to the commands in the scripts section of `package.json` in the root of this newly created project and to the documentation of [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint) — this is the tool we've used to create and compile your first simple counter contract in Tact. In fact, Blueprint can do much more than that: including tests, customizations and more.

## 🤔 Where to go next? {#next}

<p>ㅤ</p>

<Steps>

1. #### Have some blockchain knowledge already? {#next-1}

   See the [Tact Cookbook](/cookbook), which is a handy collection of everyday tasks (and solutions) every Tact developer faces during smart contract development. Use it to avoid re-inventing the wheel.

   Alternatively, check the following cheat sheets to quickly get started:

   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="💎 Coming from FunC (TON)"
       href="/book/cs/from-func"
     />
     <LinkCard
       title="🔷 Coming from Solidity (Ethereum)"
       href="/book/cs/from-solidity"
     />
   </CardGrid>

2. #### Want to know more? {#next-2}

   For further guidance on compilation, testing and deployment see the respective pages:

   * [Testing and debugging](/book/debug) page tells you everything about debugging Tact contracts
   * [Deployment](/book/deploy) page shows what deployment looks like and helps you harness the powers of [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint) for it.

   For custom plugins for your favorite editor and other tooling see the [Ecosystem](/ecosystem) section.

   Alternatively, take a look at the following broader sections:

   * [Book](/book) helps you learn the language step-by-step
   * [Cookbook](/cookbook) gives you ready-made recipes of Tact code
   * [Reference](/ref) provides a complete glossary of the standard library, grammar and evolution process
   * Finally, [Ecosystem](/ecosystem) describes "what's out there" in the Tact's and TON's ecosystems

   </CardGrid>

3. #### Feeling a bit uncomfortable? {#next-3}

   If you ever get stuck, try searching — the search box is right at the top of the documentation. There is also a handy <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> shortcut to quickly focus and start the search as you type.

   If you can't find the answer in the docs, or you've tried to do some local testing and it still didn't help — don't hesitate to reach out to Tact's flourishing community:

   <CardGrid>
     <LinkCard
       title="✈️ Telegram Group"
