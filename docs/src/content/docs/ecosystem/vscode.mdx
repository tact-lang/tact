## Quick start

Download the extension for VS Code and VSCode-based editors like VSCodium, Cursor, Windsurf and others:

- Get it on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonstudio.vscode-tact).
- Get it on the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/tonstudio/vscode-tact).
- Or install from the [`.vsix` files in nightly releases](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server/releases).

## Installation manual for VSCode

1. Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

2. Navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window. It looks like a square within a square.

3. In the Extensions view, type "Tact Language". You should see a dropdown with the extension "Tact Language" provided by [TON Studio](https://tonstudio.io). You'll see other extensions previously made by the community, but you should use the one from TON Studio as it is officially supported and developed by the Tact team.

4. Click on the "Install" button next to the extension name. Wait until the installation is complete.

5. Once the extension is installed, you may need to reload VS Code. You might see a Reload button next to the extension. Click this button when it appears.
