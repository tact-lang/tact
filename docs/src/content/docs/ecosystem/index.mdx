Welcome to the **Ecosystem** section — a bird-eye overview of Tact ecosystem, tools and ways you can start contributing to those and beyond!

Here are its main contents:

<Steps>

1. #### Security audits

   In addition to optimizing gas usage and reducing fees, the security of the Tact ecosystem is of utmost priority. Which is why there's a dedicated page for miscellaneous security audits, assessments and reports for the Tact compiler and Tact smart contracts.

2. #### Tools

   Tools is a list of official and community-made tools made specifically for Tact, or whose that play along with the language and other tools. Each tool has a brief usage details and additional information, which sometimes is missing from the respective docs or is a convenient summary available only in the Tact documentation.
