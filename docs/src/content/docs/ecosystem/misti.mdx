[Misti](https://nowarp.github.io/tools/misti/) is a static program analysis tool that supports Tact.

## What is Misti?

* **Static Program Analysis**: Misti analyzes code without executing it, scanning for [bugs and security flaws](https://nowarp.github.io/tools/misti/docs/detectors) by examining the structure and syntax. This approach catches issues early, preventing them from reaching production.

* **Custom Detectors**: Customize Misti to your specific needs by creating [custom detectors](https://nowarp.github.io/tools/misti/docs/hacking/custom-detector). This helps identify vulnerabilities that generic tools might miss, ensuring a thorough review of your code.

* **CI/CD Integration**: [Integrate](https://nowarp.github.io/tools/misti/docs/tutorial/ci-cd) Misti into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous code quality checks, catching issues before they make it to production.
