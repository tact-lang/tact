title: Exit codes
description: "An exit code is a 32-bit signed integer, which indicates whether the compute or action phase of the transaction was successful, and if not — holds the code of the exception occurred"
---

Each transaction on TON Blockchain consists of [multiple phases](https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview#transactions-and-phases). An _exit code_ is a $32$-bit signed integer, which indicates whether the [compute](#compute) or [action](#action) phase of the transaction was successful, and if not — holds the code of the exception occurred. Each exit code represents its own exception or resulting state of the transaction.

Exit codes $0$ and $1$ indicate normal (successful) execution of the [compute phase](#compute). Exit (or [result](#action)) code $0$ indicates normal (successful) execution of the [action phase](#action). Any other exit code indicates that a certain exception has occurred and that the transaction wasn't successful in one way or another, i.e. transaction was reverted or the inbound message has bounced back.

TON Blockchain reserves exit code values from $0$ to $127$, while Tact utilizes exit codes from $128$ to $255$. Note, that exit codes used by Tact indicate contract errors which can occur when using Tact-generated FunC code, and are therefore thrown in the transaction's [compute phase](#compute) and not during the compilation.

The range from $256$ to $65535$ is free for developer-defined exit codes.

:::note

  While an exit (or [result](#action)) code is a $32$-bit signed integer on TON Blockchain, an attempt to [throw](/ref/core-debug) an exit code out of bounds of the $16$-bit unsigned integer ($0 - 65535$) will cause an error with [exit code 5](#5). That's done intentionally to prevent some exit codes from being produced artificially, such as the [exit code -14](#-14).

:::

## Table of exit codes {#table}

The following table lists exit codes with an origin (where it can occur) and a short description for each. The table doesn't list the exit code of the [`require()`](/ref/core-debug#require), as it generates it depending on the concrete `error` message [String][p].

Exit code     | Origin                              | Brief description

[$136$](#136) | Tact compiler ([Compute phase][c])  | Invalid address.
[$137$](#137) | Tact compiler ([Compute phase][c])  | Masterchain support is not enabled for this contract.

:::note

  Often enough you might encounter the exit code $65535$ (or `0xffff`), which usually means the same as the [exit code 130](#130) — the received opcode is unknown to the contract as there were no receivers expecting it. When writing contracts, the exit code $65535$ is set by the developers and not by [TVM][tvm]or the Tact compiler.

## Exit codes in Blueprint projects {#blueprint}

In [Blueprint][bp] tests, exit codes from the [compute phase](#compute) are specified in the `exitCode` field of the object argument for `toHaveTransaction(){:typescript}` method of `expect(){:typescript}` matcher. The field for the [result](#action) codes (exit codes from the [action phase](#action)) in the same `toHaveTransaction(){:typescript}` method is called `actionResultCode`.

:::note

  Read more about expecting specific exit codes: [Transactions with intentional errors](/book/debug#tests-errors).

:::

Additionally, one can take a look at the result of [sending a message to a contract](/book/debug#tests-send) and discover the phases of each transaction and their values, including exit (or result) codes for [compute phase](#compute) (or [action phase](#action)).

Note, that in order to do so, you'll have to do a couple of type checks before that:

```typescript
it('tests something, you name it', async () => {
  // Send a specific message to our contract and store the results
  const res = await your_contract_name.send(…);

  // Now, we have an access to array of executed transactions,
  // with the second one (index 1) being the one that we look for
  const tx = res.transactions[1]!;

  // To do something useful with it, let's ensure that it's type is 'generic'
  // and that the compute phase in it wasn't skipped
  if (tx.description.type === "generic"
      && tx.description.computePhase.type === "vm") {
    // Finally, we're able to freely peek into the transaction for general details,
    // such as printing out the exit code of the compute phase if we so desire
    console.log(tx.description.computePhase.exitCode);
  }

  // ...
});
```

## Compute and action phases

### 0: Normal termination {#0}

This exit (or [result](#action)) code indicates a successful completion of the [compute](#compute) (or [action](#action)) phase of the transaction.

## Compute phase {#compute}

[TVM][tvm] initialization and all computations occur in the [compute phase][c].

If the compute phase fails (the resulting exit code isn't [$0$](#0) or [$1$](#1)), the transaction skips the [action phase](#action) and goes to the bounce phase. In it, the bounce message is formed for the transactions initiated by the inbound message.

### 1: Alternative termination {#1}

This is an alternative exit code for the successful execution of the [compute phase](#compute). Reserved, but never occurs.

### 2: Stack underflow {#2}

If some operation consumed more elements than there were on the stacks, the error with exit code $2$ is thrown: `Stack underflow`.

```tact
asm fun drop() { DROP }

contract Loot {
    receive("I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good") {
        try {
            // Removes 100 elements from the stack, causing an underflow
            repeat (100) { drop() }
        } catch (exitCode) {
            // exitCode is 2
        }
    }
}
```

:::

### 3: Stack overflow {#3}

If there are too many elements copied into a closure continuation or stored on the stack, an error with exit code $3$ is thrown: `Stack overflow`. Occurs rarely, unless you're deep in [Fift and TVM assembly](https://docs.ton.org/develop/fift/fift-and-tvm-assembly) trenches:

```tact
// Remember kids, don't try to overflow the stack at home!
asm fun stackOverflow() {
    <{
    }>CONT // c
    0 SETNUMARGS // c'
    2 PUSHINT // c' 2
    SWAP // 2 c'
    1 -1 SETCONTARGS // <- this blows up
}

contract ItsSoOver {
    receive("I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good") {
        try {
            stackOverflow();
        } catch (exitCode) {
            // exitCode is 3
        }
    }
}
```

:::

### 4: Integer overflow {#4}

If the value in calculation goes beyond the range from $-2^{256}$ to $2^{256} - 1$ inclusive, or there's an attempt to [divide](/book/operators#binary-divide) or [modulo](/book/operators#binary-modulo) by zero, an error with exit code $4$ is thrown: `Integer overflow`.

```tact
let x = -pow(2, 255) - pow(2, 255); // -2^{256}

try {
    -x; // integer overflow by negation
        // since the max positive value is 2^{256} - 1
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 4
}

try {
    x / 0; // division by zero!
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 4
}

try {
    x * x * x; // integer overflow!
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 4
}

// There can also be an integer overflow when doing:
// addition (+),
// subtraction (-),
// division (/) by a negative number or modulo (%) by zero
```

### 5: Integer out of range {#5}

Range check error — some integer is out of its expected range. I.e. any attempt to store an unexpected amount of data or specify an out-of-bounds value throws an error with exit code $5$: `Integer out of range`.

Examples of specifying an out-of-bounds value:

```tact
try {
    // Repeat only operates on inclusive range from 1 to 2^{31} - 1
    // and any valid integer value greater than that causes an error with exit code 5
    repeat (pow(2, 55)) {
        dump("smash. logs. I. must.");
    }
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 5
}

try {
    // Builder.storeUint() function can only use up to 256 bits, so 512 is too much:
    let s: Slice = beginCell().storeUint(-1, 512).asSlice();
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 5
}
```

### 6: Invalid opcode {#6}

If you specify an instruction that is not defined in the current [TVM][tvm] version, an error with exit code $6$ is thrown: `Invalid opcode`.

```tact
// No such thing
asm fun invalidOpcode() { x{D7FF} @addop }

contract OpOp {
    receive("I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good") {
        try {
            invalidOpcode();
        } catch (exitCode) {
            // exitCode is 6
        }
    }
}
```

### 7: Type check error {#7}

If an argument to a primitive is of an incorrect value type or there's any other mismatch in types during the [compute phase](#compute), an error with exit code $7$ is thrown: `Type check error`.

```tact
// The actual returned value type doesn't match the declared one
asm fun typeCheckError(): map<Int, Int> { 42 PUSHINT }

contract VibeCheck {
    receive("I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good") {
        try {
            // The 0th index doesn't exist
            typeCheckError().get(0)!!;
        } catch (exitCode) {
            // exitCode is 7
        }
    }
}
```

### 8: Cell overflow {#8}

From [Cells, Builders and Slices page](/book/cells#cells) of the Book:

> [`Cell{:tact}`][cell] is a [primitive][p] and a data structure, which [ordinarly](/book/cells#cells-kinds) consists of up to $1023$ continuously laid out bits and up to $4$ references (refs) to other cells.

To construct a [`Cell{:tact}`][cell], a [`Builder{:tact}`][builder] is used. If you try to store more than $1023$ bits of data or more than $4$ references to other cells, an error with exit code $8$ is thrown: `Cell overflow`.

This error can be triggered by [manual construction](/book/cells#cnp-manually) of the cells via [relevant `.loadSomething()` methods](/ref/core-cells) or when [using Structs and Messages and their convenience methods](/book/cells#cnp-structs).

```tact
// Too much bits
try {
    let data = beginCell()
        .storeInt(0, 250)
        .storeInt(0, 250)
        .storeInt(0, 250)
        .storeInt(0, 250)
        .storeInt(0, 24) // 1024 bits!
        .endCell();
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 8
}

// Too much refs
try {
    let data = beginCell()
        .storeRef(emptyCell())
        .storeRef(emptyCell())
        .storeRef(emptyCell())
        .storeRef(emptyCell())
        .storeRef(emptyCell()) // 5 refs!
        .endCell();
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 8
}
```

### 9: Cell underflow {#9}

From [Cells, Builders and Slices page](/book/cells#cells) of the Book:

> `Cell{:tact}` is a [primitive][p] and a data structure, which [ordinarly](/book/cells#cells-kinds) consists of up to $1023$ continuously laid out bits and up to $4$ references (refs) to other cells.

To parse a [`Cell{:tact}`][cell], a [`Slice{:tact}`][slice] is used. If you try to load more data or references than `Slice{:tact}` contains, an error with exit code $9$ is thrown: `Cell underflow`.

The most common cause of this error is a mismatch between the expected and actual memory layouts of the cells, so it's recommended to [use Structs and Messages for parsing](/book/cells#cnp-structs) of the cells instead of [manual parsing](/book/cells#cnp-manually) via [relevant `.loadSomething()` methods](/ref/core-cells).

```tact
// Too few bits
try {
    emptySlice().loadInt(1); // 0 bits!
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 9
}

// Too few refs
try {
    emptySlice().loadRef(); // 0 refs!
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 9
}
```

### 10: Dictionary error {#10}

In Tact, the [`map<K, V>{:tact}`](/book/maps) type is an abstraction over the ["hash" map dictionaries of FunC](https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/dictionaries#hashmap) and underlying [`HashmapE` type](https://docs.ton.org/develop/data-formats/tl-b-types#hashmap) of [TL-B][tlb] and [TVM][tvm].

If there is an incorrect manipulation of dictionaries, such as improper assumptions about their memory layout, an error with exit code $10$ is thrown: `Dictionary error`. Note, that Tact prevents you from getting this error unless you do [Fift and TVM assembly](https://docs.ton.org/develop/fift/fift-and-tvm-assembly) work yourself:

```tact
/// Pre-computed Int to Int dictionary with two entries — 0: 0 and 1: 1
const cellWithDictIntInt: Cell = cell("te6cckEBBAEAUAABAcABAgPQCAIDAEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAQQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLMbT1U=");

/// Tries to preload a dictionary from a Slice as a map<Int, Cell>
asm fun toMapIntCell(x: Slice): map<Int, Cell> { PLDDICT }

contract DictPic {
    receive("I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good") {
        try {
            // The Int to Int dictionary is being misinterpreted as a map<Int, Cell>
            let m: map<Int, Cell> = toMapIntCell(cellWithDictIntInt.beginParse());

            // And the error happens only when we touch it
            m.get(0)!!;
        } catch (exitCode) {
            // exitCode is 10
        }
    }
}
```

### 11: "Unknown" error {#11}

Described in [TVM][tvm] docs as "Unknown error, may be thrown by user programs", although most commonly used for problems with queueing a message send or problems with [get-methods](https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/get-methods).

```tact
try {
    // Unlike nativeSendMessage which uses SENDRAWMSG, this one uses SENDMSG,
    // and therefore fails in Compute phase when the message is ill-formed
    nativeSendMessageReturnForwardFee(emptyCell(), 0);
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 11
}
```

### 12: Fatal error {#12}

Fatal error. Thrown by TVM in situations deemed impossible.

### 13: Out of gas error {#13}

If there isn't enough gas to end computations in the [compute phase](#compute), the error with exit code $13$ is thrown: `Out of gas error`.

But this code isn't immediately shown as is — instead, the bitwise NOT operation is applied, which changes the value from $13$ to $-14$. And only then the code is shown.

That's done in order to prevent the resulting code ($-14$) from being produced artificially in user contracts, since all functions that can [throw an exit code](/ref/core-debug) can only specify integers in the range from $0$ to $65535$ inclusive.

```tact
try {
    repeat (pow(2, 31) - 1) {}
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is -14
}
```

### -14: Out of gas error {#-14}

See [exit code 13](#13).

### 14: Virtualization error {#14}

Virtualization error, related to [prunned branch cells](/book/cells#cells-kinds). Reserved, but never thrown.

## Action phase {#action}

The [action phase][a] is processed after the successful execution of the [compute phase](#compute). It attempts to perform the actions stored into the action list by [TVM][tvm] during the compute phase.

Some actions may fail during processing, in which case those actions may be skipped or the whole transaction may revert depending on the mode of actions. The code indicating the resulting state of the [action phase][a] is called a _result code_. Since it's also a $32$-bit signed integer that essentially serves the same purpose as _exit code_ of [compute phase](#compute), it's common to call the result code an exit code too.

### 32: Action list is invalid {#32}

If the list of actions contains [exotic cells](/book/cells#cells-kinds), an action entry cell does not have references or some action entry cell couldn't be parsed, an error with exit code $32$ is thrown: `Action list is invalid`.

:::note

  Aside from this exit code there's a boolean flag `valid`, which you can find under `description.actionPhase.valid` in the transaction results when working with [Sandbox and Blueprint](#blueprint). Transaction can set this flag to `false` even when there is some other exit code thrown from the action phase.

:::

### 33: Action list is too long {#33}

If there are more than $255$ actions queued for execution, the [action phase](#action) will throw an error with an exit code $33$: `Action list is too long`.

```tact
// For example, let's attempt to queue reservation of specific amount of nanoToncoins
// This won't fail in compute phase, but will result in exit code 33 in Action phase
repeat (256) {
    nativeReserve(ton("0.001"), ReserveAtMost);
}
```

### 34: Invalid or unsupported action {#34}

There are only four supported actions at the moment: changing the contract code, sending a message, reserving a specific amount of [nanoToncoins](/book/integers#nanotoncoin) and changing the library cell. If there's any issue with the specified action (invalid message, unsupported action, etc.), an error with exit code $34$ is thrown: `Invalid or unsupported action`.

```tact
// For example, let's try to send an ill-formed message:
nativeSendMessage(emptyCell(), 0); // won't fail in compute phase,
                                   // but will result in exit code 34 in Action phase
```

### 35: Invalid source address in outbound message {#35}

If the source address in the outbound message isn't equal to [`addr_none`](https://docs.ton.org/develop/data-formats/msg-tlb#addr_none00) or to the address of the contract that initiated this message, an error with exit code $35$ is thrown: `Invalid source address in outbound message`.

### 36: Invalid destination address in outbound message {#36}

If the destination address in the outbound message is invalid, e.g. it doesn't conform to the relevant [TL-B][tlb] schemas, contains unknown workchain ID or it has invalid length for the given workchain, an error with exit code $36$ is thrown: `Invalid destination address in outbound message`.

:::note

  If the [optional flag +2](/book/message-mode#optional-flags) is set, this error won't be thrown and the given message won't be sent.

:::

### 37: Not enough Toncoin {#37}

If all funds of the inbound message with [base mode 64](/book/message-mode#base-modes) set had been already consumed and there's not enough funds to pay for the failed action, or the [TL-B][tlb] layout of the provided value ([`CurrencyCollection`](https://docs.ton.org/develop/data-formats/msg-tlb#currencycollection)) is invalid, or there's not enough funds to pay [forward fees](https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/processing) or not enough funds after deducting fees, an error with exit code $37$ is thrown: `Not enough Toncoin`.

:::note

  If the [optional flag +2](/book/message-mode#optional-flags) is set, this error won't be thrown and the given message won't be sent.

:::

### 38: Not enough extra currencies {#38}

Besides the native currency, Toncoin, TON Blockchain supports up to $2^{32}$ extra currencies. They differ from making new [Jettons](/cookbook/jettons) because extra currencies are natively supported — one can potentially just specify an extra [`HashmapE`](https://docs.ton.org/develop/data-formats/tl-b-types#hashmap) of extra currency amounts in addition to the Toncoin amount in the internal message to another contract. Unlike Jettons, extra currencies can only be stored and transferred and do not have any other functionality.

At the moment, **there are no extra currencies** on TON Blockchain, but the exit code $38$ in cases when there is not enough extra currency to send the specified amount of it is already reserved: `Not enough extra currencies`.

:::

### 39: Outbound message doesn't fit into a cell {#39}

When processing the message, TON Blockchain tries to pack it according to the [relevant TL-B schemas](https://docs.ton.org/develop/data-formats/msg-tlb), and if it cannot an error with exit code $39$ is thrown: `Outbound message doesn't fit into a cell`.

:::note

  If attempts at sending the message fail multiple times and the [optional flag +2](/book/message-mode#optional-flags) is set, this error won't be thrown and the given message won't be sent.

### 40: Cannot process a message {#40}

If there would not be enough funds to process all the cells in a message, the message is too large or its Merkle depth is too big, an error with exit code $40$ is thrown: `Cannot process a message`.

### 41: Library reference is null {#41}

If the library reference was required during library change action, but it was null, an error with exit code $41$ is thrown: `Library reference is null`.

### 42: Library change action error {#42}

If there's an error during an attempt at library change action, an error with exit code $42$ is thrown: `Library change action error`.

### 43: Library limits exceeded {#43}

If the maximum number of cells in the library is exceeded or the maximum depth of the Merkle tree is exceeded, an error with exit code $43$ is thrown: `Library limits exceeded`.

### 50: Account state size exceeded limits {#50}

If the account state (contract storage, essentially) exceeds any of the limits specified in [config param 43 of TON Blockchain](https://docs.ton.org/develop/howto/blockchain-configs#param-43) by the end of the [action phase](#action), an error with exit code $50$ is thrown: `Account state size exceeded limits`.

If the configuration is absent, default values are:

* `max_msg_bits` is equal to $2^{21}$ — maximum message size in bits.
* `max_msg_cells` is equal to $2^{13}$ — maximum number of [cells][cell] a message can occupy.
* `max_library_cells` is equal to $1000$ — maximum number of [cells][cell] that can be used as [library reference cells](/book/cells#cells-kinds).
* `max_vm_data_depth` is equal to $2^{9}$ — maximum [cells][cell] depth in messages and account state.
* `ext_msg_limits.max_size` is equal to $65535$ — maximum external message size in bits.
* `ext_msg_limits.max_depth` is equal to $2^{9}$ — maximum external message [depth](/book/cells#cells-representation).
* `max_acc_state_cells` is equal to $2^{16}$ — maximum number of [cells][cell] that an account state can occupy.
* `max_acc_state_bits` is equal to $2^{16} * 1023$ — maximum account state size in bits.
* `max_acc_public_libraries` is equal to $2^{8}$ — maximum number of [library reference cells](/book/cells#cells-kinds) that an account state can use on the [masterchain](/book/masterchain).
* `defer_out_queue_size_limit` is equal to $2^{8}$ — maximum number of outbound messages to be queued (regards validators and collators).

## Tact compiler

Tact utilizes exit codes from $128$ to $255$. Note, that exit codes used by Tact indicate contract errors which can occur when using Tact-generated FunC code, and are therefore thrown in the transaction's [compute phase](#compute) and not during the compilation.

### 128: Null reference exception {#128}

If there's a non-null assertion, such as the [`!!{:tact}`](/book/operators#unary-non-null-assert) operator, and the checked value is [`null{:tact}`](/book/optionals), an error with exit code $128$ is thrown: `Null reference exception`.

```tact
let gotcha: String? = null;

try {
    // Asserting that the value isn't null, which isn't the case!
    dump(gotcha!!);
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 128
}
```

### 129: Invalid serialization prefix {#129}

Reserved, but due to a number of prior checks it cannot be thrown unless one hijacks the contract code before deployment and changes the opcodes of the [Messages][message] expected to be received in the contract.

### 130: Invalid incoming message {#130}

If the received internal or external message isn't handled by the contract, an error with exit code $130$ is thrown: `Invalid incoming message`. It usually happens when the contract doesn't have a receiver for the particular message and its opcode prefix (32-bit integer header).

Consider the following contract:

```tact
import "@stdlib/deploy";

contract Dummy with Deployable {}
```

If you try to send any message, except for [`Deploy{:tact}`](/ref/stdlib-deploy#deploy) provided by [`@stdlib/deploy`](/ref/stdlib-deploy), the contract won't have a receiver for it and thus would throw an error with exit code $130$.

### 131: Constraints error {#131}

Constraints error. Reserved, but never thrown.

### 132: Access denied {#132}

If you use the [`Ownable{:tact}`](/ref/stdlib-ownable#ownable) [trait][ct] from the [`@stdlib/ownable`](/ref/stdlib-ownable) library, the helper function `requireOwner(){:tact}` provided by it will throw an error with exit code $132$ if the sender of the inbound message won't match the specified owner: `Access denied`.

```tact
import "@stdlib/ownable";

contract Hal9k with Ownable {
    owner: Address;

    init(owner: Address) {
        self.owner = owner; // set the owner address upon deployment
    }

    receive("I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.") {
        // Checks that the message sender's address equals to the owner address,
        // and if not — throws an error with exit code 132.
        self.requireOwner();

        // ... you do you ...
    }
}
```

### 133: Contract stopped {#133}

A message has been sent to a stopped contract. Reserved, but never thrown.

### 134: Invalid argument {#134}

If there is an invalid or unexpected argument value, an error with exit code $134$ is thrown: `Invalid argument`.

Here are some of the functions in Tact which can throw an error with this exit code:

1. [`Int.toFloatString(digits){:tact}`](/ref/core-strings#inttofloatstring): if the `digits` is not in the interval: $0 <$ `digits` $< 78$.

2. [`String.fromBase64(){:tact}`](/ref/core-strings#stringfrombase64) and [`Slice.fromBase64(){:tact}`](/ref/core-strings#slicefrombase64): if the given [`String{:tact}`][p] or [`Slice{:tact}`][slice] contains non-Base64 characters.

```tact
try {
    // 0 is code of NUL in ASCII and it is not valid Base64
    let code: Slice = beginCell().storeUint(0, 8).asSlice().fromBase64();
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 134
}
```

### 135: Code of a contract was not found {#135}

If the code of the contract doesn't match the one saved in TypeScript wrappers, the error with exit code $135$ will be thrown: `Code of a contract was not found`.

### 136: Invalid address {#136}

A value of type [`Address{:tact}`][p] is valid in Tact when:

* It occupies $267$ bits: $11$ bits for the chain ID prefix and $256$ bits for the [address itself](https://docs.ton.org/learn/overviews/addresses#address-of-smart-contract).
* It belongs to either: basechain (ID $0$) or masterchain (ID $-1$), with the latter requiring [masterchain support](/book/masterchain#support) to be enabled.

If the [`Address{:tact}`][p] isn't valid, the error with exit code $136$ will be thrown: `Invalid address`.

```tact
// Only basechain (ID 0) or masterchain (ID -1) are supported by Tact
let unsupportedChainID = 1;

try {
    // Zero address in unsupported workchain
    dump(newAddress(unsupportedChainID, 0));
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 136
}
```

### 137: Masterchain support is not enabled for this contract {#137}

Any attempts to point to masterchain (ID $-1$) or otherwise interact with it without [enabling masterchain support](/book/masterchain#support) throw an exception with exit code $137$: `Masterchain support is not enabled for this contract`.

```tact
let masterchainID = -1;

try {
    // Zero address in masterchain without the config option set
    dump(newAddress(masterchainID, 0));
} catch (exitCode) {
    // exitCode is 137
}
