title: Learn Tact in Y minutes
description: "Take a whirlwind tour of the Tact smart contract programming language. A scenic voyage inspired by the famous learnXinYminutes website."
---

Tact is a fresh programming language for TON Blockchain that is focused on efficiency and ease of development. It is a good fit for complex smart contracts, quick onboarding, and rapid prototyping.

You can try Tact without installing anything locally using the [Web IDE](https://ide.ton.org). In addition, most examples below have an "Open in Web IDE" button for your convenience.

## "Hello, World!" {#hello-world}

```tact
// Defining a contract
contract HelloWorld {
    // Listens to incoming Ping messages
    receive(msg: Ping) {
        // Sends a Pong reply message
        reply(Pong {}.toCell());
    }

    // Listens to incoming Hello messages
    receive(msg: Hello) {
        // Replies with the received Hello message
        reply(msg.toCell());
    }

    // Listens to incoming empty messages,
    // which are very handy and cheap for the deployments.
    receive() {
        // Forward the remaining value in the
        // incoming message back to the sender.
        cashback(sender());
    }
}

// A helper inlined function to send binary messages.
// See the "Primitive types" section below for more info about cells.
inline fun reply(msgBody: Cell) {
    message(MessageParameters {
        to: sender(),
        value: 0,
        mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors,
        body: msgBody,
    });
}

// Empty message structs with specified 32-bit integer prefix.
// See the "Structs and message structs" section below for more info.
message(1) Ping {}
message(2) Pong {}
message(3) Hello {}
```

## Primitive types

```tact
fun showcase() {
    // There are two main groups of primitive types in Tact: integers and cells.
    // All other primitive types are derivatives of those two.

    // ---
    // Integers,
    // always 257-bit signed in runtime operations,
    // but may have different lengths in persistent contract's state (storage)
    // ---

    let one_plus_one: Int = 1 + 1; // 2
    let two_by_two: Int = 2 / 2;   // 1
    let three_by_two: Int = 3 / 2; // 1, because the division operator rounds
                                   // toward -∞, which is identical to // operator
                                   // from Python

    let one_billion = 1_000_000_000; // decimal
    let binary_mask = 0b1_1111_1111; // binary
    let permissions = 0o7_5_5;       // octal
    let heHex = 0xFF80_0000_0000;    // hexadecimal

    let nanoToncoin: Int = 1;    // 1 nanoToncoin = 0.000,000,001 Toncoin
    let toncoin: Int = ton("1"); // 1 Toncoin = 1,000,000,000 nanoToncoin


    // ---
    // Booleans: true and false.
    // They take only 1 bit in persistent storage.
    // ---

    let factual: Bool = !!(true || false);
    let fax: Bool = true && factual;


    // ---
    // Addresses of smart contracts,
    // deterministically obtained by combining the initial code and initial data.
    // ---

    // Address of the current contract
    let myAddr: Address = myAddress();

    // You can parse the Address to view components of the standard address:
    // * a workchain ID: 8-bit signed Int
    // * and an account ID: 256-bit unsigned Int
    let addrComponents: StdAddress = parseStdAddress(myAddr.asSlice());
    addrComponents.workchain; // 0, basechain: the most commonly used workchain on TON
    addrComponents.address;   // ...lots of digits...


    // ---
    // Cells, Builders, Slices.
    // ---

    // Cell is an immutable data structure that can contain up to 1023 bits
    // with up to 4 reference to other cells. Cyclic references are prohibited.
    let emptyC: Cell = emptyCell();

    // Cells are a fundamental primitive and data structure on TON Blockchain:
    // contracts communicate and interact by sending and receiving cells while
    // their code and data are themselves stored as cells on the blockchain
    // the code and the data of each contract are cells and contracts
    // communicate and interact by sending and receiving cells.
    //
    // Furthermore, all data layouts are also expressed in terms of cells and
    // cell (de)serialization primitives. That said, Tact provides declarative means
    // to express (de)serialization to and from cells conveniently —
    // see the "Structs and message structs" subsection below for more info.

    // Builder is an immutable primitive to construct (compose) cells.
    let bb: Builder = beginCell()
        .storeUint(42, 6)  // storing 42 using 6 bits
        .storeInt(42, 7)   // storing 42 using 7 bits (signed Int)
        .storeBool(true)   // writing 1 as a single bit
        .storeBit(true)    // alias to storeBool()
        .storeCoins(40)    // common way of storing nanoToncoins
        .storeAddress(myAddress())
        .storeRef(emptyC); // storing a reference
    let composed: Cell = bb.endCell();

    // Slice is a mutable primitive to deconstruct (parse) cells.
    let target: Slice = composed.asSlice(); // let's start parsing `composed` Cell

    // The type ascription is optional for most cases except for maps
    // and optional types, but we'll discuss those in the
    // "Composite types" section below.
    let fortyTwo = target.loadUint(6); // taking 6 bits out of the `target` Slice,
                                       // mutating it in the process

    // If you don't want the result, you can ignore it with a wildcard.
    let _ = target.loadInt(7);

    // Finally, there are methods to skip the value, i.e., to discard it.
    target.skipBool();

    // Manual composition and parsing of Cells is tedious,
    // error-prone and is generally not recommended.
    // Instead, prefer using structures: struct and message struct types.
    // See the "Composite types" section below for more info.


    // ---
    // Strings are immutable sequences of characters,
    // which are used mainly to send and receive text message bodies.
    // ---

    // String literals are wrapped in double-quotes and can contain escape sequences,
    // but they intentionally cannot be concatenated via any operators.
    let str: String = "I am a string literal, 👻!"; // see the "Expressions" section for more

    // Strings are useful for storing text,
    // so they can be converted to a Cell type to be used as message bodies.
    let noComments: Cell = "yes comments".asComment(); // prefixes a string with 32 zero bits
}

// Finally, under the hood, Address and String types are a Slice,
// although with a well-defined distinct data layout for each.
//
// While implicit type conversions aren't allowed in Tact,
// there are extension functions that can be used for those purposes,
// such as String.asSlice() or Address.asSlice().
//
// Advanced users can introduce their own casts by using assembly functions.
// See the "Functions" section below for more info.

// An empty contract needed for the showcase above to work.
contract MyContract() {}

## Composite types

### Optionals {#composite-optionals}

```tact
fun showcase() {
    // An optional is a value than can be of any type or null.
    // Null is a special value that represents the intentional
    // absence of any other value.

    // Int keys to Int values.
    // Type ascription of optionals is mandatory.
    let optionalVal: Int? = null;
    optionalVal = 255;

    // If you're certain that the value isn't null at a given moment,
    // use the non-null assertion operator !! to access it.
    dump(optionalVal!!);

    // If you are not certain, then it is better to explicitly compare
    // the value to null to avoid errors at runtime.
    if (optionalVal != null) {
        // here we go!
    } else {
        // not happening right now
    }
}

// You can make almost any variable or field optional by adding
// a question mark (?) after its type name.
// The only exceptions are map<K, V> and bounced<Message>,
// in which you cannot make the inner key/value type (in the case of a map)
// or the inner message struct (in the case of a bounced) optional.
```

### Maps {#composite-maps}

```tact
fun showcase() {
    // The composite type map<K, V> is used to associate
    // keys of type K with corresponding values of type V.

    // A map of Int keys to Int values.
    // Type ascription is mandatory.
    let myMap: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();

    // Maps have a number of built-in methods.
    myMap.set(0, 10);          // key 0 now points to value 10
    myMap.set(0, 42);          // overriding the value under key 0 with 42
    myMap.get(0)!!;            // 42, because get can return null if the key doesn't exist
    myMap.replace(1, 55);      // false, because there was no key 1 and map didn't change
    myMap.replaceGet(0, 10)!!; // 42, because the key 0 exists and the old value there was 42
    myMap.get(0)!!;            // 10, since we've just replaced the value with .replaceGet
    myMap.del(0);              // true, because the map contained an entry under key 0
    myMap.del(0);              // false and not an error, because deletion is idempotent
    myMap.exists(0);           // false, there is no entry under key 0
    myMap.isEmpty();           // true, there is no other entries

    // Statically known `.set`s can be replaced by map literals.
    // That way, map entries will be defined at compile-time and consume much less gas.
    let myMap2: map<Int as uint8, Int as int13> = map<Int as uint8, Int as int13> {
        // Key expression: Value expression
        1 + 2: 10 * pow2(3), // key 3, value 80
        1 + 3: 20 * pow2(4), // key 4, value 320
    };

    // In most cases, to compare two maps it's sufficient to use the shallow
    // comparison via the equality == and inequality != operators.
    myMap == emptyMap(); // true

    // To traverse maps, the foreach statement is used.
    // See the "Statements" section below for more info.
    foreach (k, v in myMap) {
        // ...do something for each entry, if any
    }

    // There are many other allowed kinds of map value types for Int keys
    let _: map<Int, Bool> = emptyMap();    // Int keys to Bool values
    let _: map<Int, Cell> = emptyMap();    // Ints to Cells
    let _: map<Int, Address> = emptyMap(); // Ints to Addresses
    let _: map<Int, AnyStruct> = emptyMap();  // Ints to some structs
    let _: map<Int, AnyMessage> = emptyMap(); // Ints to some message structs

    // And all the same value types for maps with Address keys are also allowed.
    let _: map<Address, Int> = emptyMap();     // Address keys to Int values
    let _: map<Address, Bool> = emptyMap();    // Addresses to Bools
    let _: map<Address, Cell> = emptyMap();    // Addresses to Cells
    let _: map<Address, Address> = emptyMap(); // Addresses to Addresses
    let _: map<Address, AnyStruct> = emptyMap();  // Addresses to some structs
    let _: map<Address, AnyMessage> = emptyMap(); // Addresses to some message structs

    // Under the hood, empty maps are nulls, which is why it's important to provide a type ascription.
    let _: map<Int, Int> = null; // like emptyMap(), but less descriptive and generally discouraged

    // Furthermore, as with many other types, maps are just Cells with a distinct data layout.
    // Therefore, you can type cast any map back to its underlying Cell type.
    myMap.asCell();
}

// Serialization of integer keys or values is possible but only meaningful
// for maps as fields of structures and maps in the contract's persistent state.
// See the "Structs and message structs" and "Persistent state"
// sections below for more info.

// Finally, mind the limits — maps are quite gas-expensive
// and have an upper limit of around 32k entries for the whole contract.
//
// On TON, contracts are very limited in their state, and for large
// or unbounded (infinitely large) maps, it is better to use contract sharding
// and essentially make the entire blockchain part of your maps.
//
// See this approach in action for the Jetton (token)
// contract system by the end of this tour.

// The following are dummy structures needed for the showcase above to work.
struct AnyStruct { field: Int }
message AnyMessage { field: Int }

### Structs and message structs {#composite-structures}

```tact
// Structs and message structs allow multiple values to be packed together
// in a single type. They are very useful for (de)serialization of Cells
// and for usage as parameters or return types in functions.

// Struct containing a single value
struct One { number: Int; }

// Struct with default fields, fields of optional types, and nested structs
struct Params {
    name: String = "Satoshi"; // default value

    age: Int?; // field with an optional type Int?
               // and an implicit default value of null

    val: One; // nested struct One
}

// You can instruct how to (de)compose the Cells to and from structs
// by specifying certain serialization options after the `as` keyword.
struct SeriesXX {
    i64: Int as int64;  // signed 64-bit integer
    u32: Int as uint32; // unsigned 32-bit integer
    ufo51: Int as uint51; // uneven formats are allowed too,
                          // so this is an unsigned 51-bit integer

    // In general, uint1 through uint256 and int1 through int257
    // are valid serialization formats for integer values.
    maxi: Int as int257; // Int is serialized as int257 by default,
                         // but now it is explicitly specified

    // If this struct will be obtained from some Slice,
    // you can instruct the compiler to place the remainder of that Slice
    // as the last field of the struct, and even type cast the value
    // of that field to Cell, Builder or Slice at runtime.
    lastFieldName: Cell as remaining; // there can only be a single `remaining` field,
                                      // and it must be the last one in the struct
}

// The order of fields matters, as it corresponds to the resulting
// memory layout when the struct will be used to compose a Cell
// or to parse a Slice back to the struct.
struct Order {
    first: Int;     // 257 continuously laid out bits
    second: Cell;   // up to 1023 bits,
                    // which will be placed in a separate ref
                    // when composing a Cell
    third: Address; // 267 bits
}

// Message structs are almost the same as regular structs,
// but they have a 32-bit integer header in their serialization.
// This unique numeric ID is commonly referred to as an opcode (operation code),
// and it allows message structs to be used with special receiver functions
// that distinguish incoming messages based on this ID.
message ImplicitlyAssignedId {} // no fields,
                                // but not empty because of the automatically
                                // generated and implicitly set 32-bit Int opcode

// You can manually override an opcode with any compile-time expression
// that evaluates to a non-negative 32-bit integer.

// This message has an opcode of 898001897, which is the evaluated
// integer value of the specified compile-time expression.
message((crc32("Tact") + 42) & 0xFFFF_FFFF) MsgWithExprOpcode {
    // All the contents are defined identical to regular structs.
    field1: Int as uint4;         // serialization
    field2: Bool?;                // optionals
    field3: One;                  // nested structs
    field4: ImplicitlyAssignedId; // nested message structs
}

// Some usage examples.
fun usage() {
    // Instantiation of a struct.
    // Notice the lack of the "new" keyword used for this in many
    // other traditional languages.
    let val: One = One { number: 50 };

    // You can omit the fields with default values.
    let _ = Params { val }; // the field punning works —
                           // instead of `val: val` you could write just `val`

    // Convert a struct to a Cell or a Slice.
    let valCell = val.toCell();
    let valSlice = val.toSlice();

    // Obtain a struct from a Cell or a Slice.
    let _ = One.fromCell(valCell);
    let _ = One.fromSlice(valSlice);

    // Conversion works both ways.
    One.fromCell(val.toCell()).toCell() == valCell;
    One.fromSlice(val.toSlice()).toSlice() == valSlice;
}
```

## Operators

```tact
fun showcase() {
    // Let's omit the type ascriptions and let the compiler infer the types.
    let five = 5; // = is an assignment operator,
                  // but it can be a part of the assignment statement only,
                  // because there is no assignment expression
    let four = 4;

    // Most operators below have augmented assignment versions, like +=, -=, etc.
    // See the "Statements" section below for more info.

    // Common arithmetic operators have predictable precedences.
    five + four - five * four / five % four; // 9

    // You can change order of operations with parentheses.
    (five + (four - five)) * four / (five % four); // 16

    // The % is the modulo, not the remainder operator.
    1 % five;  // 1
    1 % -five; // -4

    // Negation and bitwise NOT.
    -five;    // -5: negation of 5
    ~five;    // -6: bitwise NOT of 5
    -(~five); // 6: bitwise NOT, then negation
    ~(-five); // 4: negation, then bitwise NOT

    // Bitwise shifts.
    five << 2; // 20
    four >> 2; // 1
    -four >> 2; // -1, because negation is applied first
                // and >> performs arithmetic or sign-propagating right shift

    // Other common bitwise operators.
    five & four; // 4, due to bitwise AND
    five | four; // 5, due to bitwise OR
    five ^ four; // 1, due to bitwise XOR

    // Relations.
    five == four;     // false
    five != four;     // true
    five > four;      // true
    five < four;      // false
    five - 1 >= four; // true
    five - 1 <= four; // true

    // Logical checks.
    !(five == 5);       // false, because of the inverse ! operator
    false && five == 5; // false, because && is short-circuited
    true || five != 5;  // true, because || is also short-circuited

    // The non-null assertion operator raises a compilation error if the value
    // is null or if the type of the value is not optional,
    // i.e., it can never be null.
    let maybeFive: Int? = five;
    maybeFive!!; // 5

    // Ternary operator ?: is right-associative.
    false ? 1 : (false ? 2 : 3); // 3
    false ? 1 : true ? 2 : 3;    // 2
}

## Functions

## Message exchange and communication {#messaging}

```tact
// On TON, contracts cannot read each other's states and cannot synchronously
// call each other's functions. Instead, the actor model of communication is
// applied — contracts send or receive asynchronous messages that may or may not
// influence each other's state.
//
// Each message is a Cell with a well-defined, complex structure of serialization.
// However, Tact provides you with simple abstractions to send, receive, and
// (de)serialize messages to and from various structures.
//
// Each message has a so-called message body,
// which can be represented by message structs with certain opcodes.
message(123) MyMsg { someVal: Int as uint8 }

// Messages can also omit their bodies, or have them be empty,
// in which case they won't have any opcode and could only be handled
// by the empty message body receiver or "empty receiver" for short.
//
// See the "Contracts and traits" section below for more info.

// Finally, sending messages is not free and requires
// some forward fees to be paid upfront.
fun examples() {
    // To keep some amount of nanoToncoins on the balance,
    // use nativeReserve() prior to calling message-sending functions:
    nativeReserve(ton("0.01"), ReserveAtMost);

    // There are many message-sending functions for various cases.
    // See the links given right after this code block.
    //
    // This is most general and simple function to send an internal message:
    message(MessageParameters {
        // Recipient address.
        to: address("UQDtFpEwcFAEcRe5mLVh2N6C0x-_hJEM7W61_JLnSF74p9dz"),

        // Optional message body.
        body: null, // empty body, no opcodes, nothing

        // Some nanoToncoins to send, possibly none.
        value: 0, // do not attach any nanoToncoins to the message

        // Configure various modes of sending the message in regards to how
        // the funds will be charged, how message will be processed, etc.
        mode: SendPayGasSeparately | SendIgnoreErrors,

        // Whether to allow this message to bounce back to this contract
        // in case the recipient contract doesn't exist or wasn't able to
        // process the message.
        bounce: true, // to handle messages that bounced back, a special bounced
                      // receiver function is used. See the "Contracts and traits"
                      // section below for more info.
    });

    // To do refunds and forward excess values from the incoming message
    // back to the original sender, use the cashback message-sending function:
    cashback(sender());

    // Note that all message-sending functions only queue the messages when called.
    // The actual processing and sending will be done in the next, action phase
    // of the transaction, where many messages can fail for various reasons.
    //
    // For example, if the remaining value from the incoming message was used by
    // the first function, the subsequent functions that would try to do the same
    // will fail. The optional SendIgnoreErrors flag seen above hides those failures
    // and ignores the unprocessed messages. It's not a silver bullet, and you're
    // advised to always double-check the message flow in your contracts.
}

// Already bounced messages cannot be sent by any contract and are guaranteed
// to be received only by the current contract that did sent them as internal
// messages first.
//
// Additionally, external messages cannot be sent by the contract,
// only processed by it.
//
// To receive internal messages (bounced or sent directly) and external messages,
// provide corresponding receiver functions. See the "Contracts and traits"
// section below for more info.
//
// To organize child-parent contract message exchange, see the "Jetton contracts"
// section below.

## Contracts and traits

```tact
// Tact allows you to import Tact and FunC code.

## Constants

```tact
// Global, top-level constants.
// Type ascription is mandatory.
const MY_CONSTANT: Int =
    ascii("⚡"); // expressions are computed at compile-time

// Trait-level constants.
trait MyTrait {
    const I_AM_ON_THE_TRAIT_LEVEL: Int = 420;

    // On the trait-level, you can make constants abstract,
    // which requires the contracts that inherit this trait
    // to override those constants with some values.
    abstract const OVERRIDE_ME: Int;

    // Virtual constants allow overrides, but do not require them.
    virtual const YOU_CAN_OVERRIDE_ME: Int = crc32("babecafe");
}

// Contract-level constants.
contract MyContract() with MyTrait {
    const iAmOnTheContractLevel: Int = 4200;

    // Because this contract inherits from MyTrait,
    // the I_AM_ON_THE_TRAIT_LEVEL constant is also in scope of this contract,
    // but we cannot override it.

    // However, we can override the virtual constant.
    override const YOU_CAN_OVERRIDE_ME: Int = crc32("deadbeef");

    // And we MUST override and define the value of the abstract constant.
    override const OVERRIDE_ME: Int = ton("0.5");
}

// All constants are inlined, i.e., their values are embedded in the resulting
// code in all places where their values are referenced in Tact code.

// from anywhere, while contract and trait-level constants are
// only accessible within them via `self` references.

## Persistent state {#state}

```tact
// Contracts can define state variables that persist between contract calls,
// and thus commonly referred to as storage variables.
// Contracts in TON pay rent in proportion to the amount of persistent space
// they consume, so compact representations via serialization are encouraged.
// Unlike variables, constants do not consume space in the persistent state.

contract StateActor(
    // Persistent state variables
    oneByte: Int as uint8,  // ranges from -128 to 127
    twoBytes: Int as int16, // ranges from -32,768 to 32,767
    currency: Int as coins, // variable bit-width format, which occupies
                            // between 4 and 124 bits
                            // and ranges from 0 to 2^120 - 1
) {

    receive() {
        // Serialization to smaller values only applies for the state between
        // transactions and incoming or outgoing message bodies.
        // This is because at runtime everything is computed
        // at their maximum capacity and all integers are assumed to
        // be 257-bit signed ones.
        //
        // That is, the following would not cause any runtime overflows,
        // but will throw an out of range error only after the execution of
        // this receiver is completed.
        self.oneByte = -1;  // this won't fail immediately
        self.oneByte = 500; // and this won't fail right away either

    } // only here, at the end of the compute phase,

## Testing and debugging {#debug}

## Contract deployment {#deploy}

        // Notice that we do not need to explicitly specify the Address.
        // That's because it will be computed on the fly from the initial package.
    });
}

// However, before your contracts can start deploying other contracts on-chain,
// it is common to first send an external message to your TON wallet from off-chain.
// Then, your wallet will be the contract that deploys the target one.

## Example contracts {#examples}

Let's put our newly acquired information of syntax and some semantics to the test.

### Counter contract {#examples-counter}

```tact

    id: Int as uint32, // a unique id to deploy multiple instances
                       // of this contract in a same workchain
    // Their default or initial values are supplied during deployment.
) {
    // Registers a receiver of empty messages from other contracts.
    // It handles internal messages with `null` body
    // and is very handy and cheap for the deployments.
    receive() {
        // Forward the remaining value in the
        // incoming message back to the sender.

### Jetton contracts {#examples-jetton}

The tokens on TON Blockchain are commonly called Jettons. The distinction is made because they work differently from ERC-20 tokens or others.

This is due to the scalable and distributed approach that works best on TON: instead of having a single giant contract with a big hashmap of addresses of token holders, Jettons instead have a single minter contract that creates individual contracts called Jetton wallets per each holder.

For more, refer to the following resources:

* [TON Jettons Processing](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/jettons) in TON Docs.
* Jetton standards: [TEP-64](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0064-token-data-standard.md), [TEP-74](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md), and [TEP-89](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0089-jetton-wallet-discovery.md).
