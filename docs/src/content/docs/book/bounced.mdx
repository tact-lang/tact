When a contract sends a message with the flag `bounce` set to `true{:tact}`, and if the message isn't processed properly, it will bounce back to the sender. This is useful when you want to ensure that the message has been processed properly and, if not, revert the changes.

## Caveats

Currently, bounced messages in TON can have at most 256 bits of payload and no references, but the amount of useful data bits when handling messages in `bounced` receivers is at most 224, since the first 32 bits are occupied by the message opcode. This means that you can't recover much of the data from the bounced message, for instance you cannot fit an address into a bounced message, since regular internal addresses need 267 bits to be represented.

Tact helps you to check if your message fits the limit, and if it doesn't, suggests using a special type constructor `bounced<M>{:tact}` for the bounced message receiver, which constructs a partial representation of the message that fits within the required limits.

Note that the inner [message struct][message] of the `bounced<M>{:tact}` type constructor cannot be [optional](/book/optionals).

```tact
contract Bounce() {
    // COMPILATION ERROR! Only named type can be bounced<>
    bounced(msg: bounced<BB?>) {}
    //           ~~~~~~~~~~~~
}

message BB {}
```

Only the first message fields that fit into the 224 bits will be available to use in bounced message receivers. Sometimes you need to rearrange the order of the fields in your message so the relevant ones would fit into the limit.

```tact
contract Bounce() {
    bounced(msg: bounced<TwoFields>) {
        // COMPILATION ERROR! Maximum size of the bounced message is 224 bits...
        msg.f2;
        //  ~~
    }
}

message TwoFields {
    f1: Int as uint224; // only this field will fit in a bounced message body
    f2: Int;
}
```

For gas optimization reasons, unrecognized bounced messages are ignored by Tact contracts and do not cause erroneous, non-zero [exit codes](/book/exit-codes). That is, if there is no relevant [`bounced(){:tact}` message receiver](#bounced-message-receiver) or no [fallback bounced receiver](#fallback), messages sent from the contract, rejected by their intended recipient and bounced back to the original contract will not be processed, apart from collecting their value and paying any related fees.

This behavior is unlike the non-bounced messages such as regular internal or external messages, where if the contract does not handle the message, an error with [exit code 130](/book/exit-codes#130) is thrown: `Invalid incoming message`. Not throwing such errors for bounced messages is a common pattern on TON Blockchain, to which Tact adheres.

## Bounced message receiver

:::caution

  Bounced text messages are not supported yet.

:::

To receive a bounced message, define a `bounced(){:tact}` [receiver function](/book/contracts#receiver-functions) in your [contract](/book/contracts) or a [trait](/book/types#traits):

```tact {2-4}
contract MyContract {
    bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Fallback bounced message receiver {#fallback}

To process bounced messages manually, you can use a fallback definition that handles a raw [`Slice{:tact}`](/book/cells#slices) directly. Note that such a receiver will get **all** the bounced messages produced by your contract:

```tact /rawMsg: Slice/
contract MyContract {
    bounced(rawMsg: Slice) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
