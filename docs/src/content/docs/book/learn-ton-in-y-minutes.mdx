description: "Take a whirlwind tour of TON Blockchain, a decentralized, open, and self-governing network. A scenic voyage inspired by the famous learnXinYminutes website."

Think of it as a cheat sheet of sorts when just starting. -- add a start to this paragraph.

NOTE: There's a lot to fill in, and initial rough notes on what to add were sent through the LLM mixer just to make them temporarily look somewhat presentable. All texts below will be rewritten by hand, and then checked with various tools.

NOTE: This is auxiliary anyways, the main target of the PR is the Tact page that follows.

### Something something smart contracts

NOTE: Blockchain — a distributed ledger of data in the form of a chain of blocks recording transaction information for every event on the network.

NOTE: Smart contract — self-executing code that oversees and enables operations with the help of mathematical algorithms and without human intervention.

Rewrite in human × dev terms.

### Smart contracts are composed of code and data

Each contract consists of both code and data components, which are stored on the blockchain. This combination defines the contract's functionality and state.

### Contracts pay storage fees

Storing contracts on the blockchain isn't free. There are fees associated with such storage, as well as limits on how much can be stored. If a contract fails to pay these fees, it will eventually be frozen and later removed from the blockchain altogether.

### Cells are the primary data type

Both code and data in TON are represented as cells. While there are other data types available at runtime, between transactions the state is stored via cells. Message passing is essentially cell exchange.

For more information about types directly accessible within Tact contracts, see: [Types](/book/types) (feels verbose, do rewrite)

## Addresses

### Standard contract addresses

There are several kinds of addresses in TON, but most commonly used ones can be represented by a StdAddress struct in the Core library, consisting of chain ID and hash ID components.

### Address acquisition is deterministic

The address of a contract is deterministically derived from its initial code and initial data supplied at deployment. Even if the code, data, or both change in the future, the address remains the same.

### Addresses have different display notations

The most basic notation for writing addresses is by separating values by a colon (raw address format). However, the address displayed in your wallet will be different, using UQ or EQ notation.

### Addresses are unique for a given workchain

Since TON blockchain is distributed and sharded into chains, addresses uniquely identify contracts within their workchain. This means no two contracts within the same chain can have identical addresses.

## Communication basics

### Message passing is everything

Contracts on TON communicate exclusively by passing messages - they cannot directly read each other's state. Every contract is reactive, first receiving a message or getter call before performing operations.

Messages can be sent onchain (internal) or offchain (external). Getters are special methods that can only be called offchain and cannot modify the contract's state.

### Deployments are done via messages

Contract deployment is also initiated by receiving a message. Technically, all accounts and addresses that aren't frozen or deployed are considered uninitialized.

### Message opcodes as their tags

While messages contain many parts, the message body is most essential. The first 32 bits of the message body serve as its opcode, effectively tagging the message.

### When things go awry, transactions can revert or bounce back

Messages can be set to bounce back if the receiving contract doesn't recognize the message opcode or lacks a handler for it. If errors occur during certain transaction phases, messages may also bounce back.

Only 256 bits of message body contents are preserved in bounced messages - the 32-bit opcode and first 224 bits of the remaining data.

### External messages have to confirm

TODO: fill in

## Transaction basics

### Shards and Blocks

TON's architecture involves shards for scalability and a specific block structure.

### Transaction phases

Transactions in TON proceed through distinct phases that handle different aspects of execution.

### Compute phase

The compute phase is where the TON Virtual Machine (TVM) executes smart contract code. Code written in Tact language is compiled to a format compatible with this virtual machine.

### Action phase

Due to TON's multi-phase transaction architecture, messages created during computation aren't sent immediately. When you call the `message()` function, the message cell is computed and queued for sending during the action phase that follows the compute phase.

Beyond message sending, three other actions may be queued during compute phase and performed during action phase:
* Code modifications
* Library references
* Resource reservations

### Compute and forward fees

Messages on TON aren't free - they incur forward fees and compute costs. However, getter calls are free to execute.

### Toncoin is the main currency

Toncoin serves as the primary currency in the TON ecosystem, with additional or _extra currencies_ planned for future implementation.
