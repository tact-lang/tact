In TON Blockchain, a special chain called ["masterchain"](https://docs.ton.org/learn/overviews/ton-blockchain#masterchain-blockchain-of-blockchains) is used to synchronize message routing and transaction execution, so that nodes in the network can fix a particular point in a multi-chain state and reach a consensus about that state.

Masterchain stores the [network configuration](/ref/core-advanced#getconfigparam) and the final state of all [workchains](https://docs.ton.org/learn/overviews/ton-blockchain#workchain-blockchain-with-your-own-rules). It carries fundamental protocol information, including current settings, a list of active validators and their stakes, active workchains, and associated [shardchains](https://docs.ton.org/develop/blockchain/shards). Most importantly, it maintains a record of the latest block hashes for all workchains and shardchains, enforcing consensus across the network.

## How contract is protected from masterchain {#protection}

Tact enforces all contracts to use the [basechain](https://docs.ton.org/develop/blockchain/shards), which is the default workchain with ID $0$. This is done to prevent masterchain addresses from being used in the contract.

Any attempts to point to masterchain or otherwise interact with it without [enabling masterchain support](#support) throw an exception with [exit code 137](/book/exit-codes#137): `Masterchain support is not enabled for this contract`.

That is, accidental deployments to the masterchain, receiving messages from masterchain accounts, sending messages to such accounts, and using masterchain addresses or its chain ID ($-1$) are all prohibited by default.

## Enabling masterchain support in compilation options {#support}

:::caution

Most contracts don't need to be deployed on a masterchain or have any interactions on a masterchain. That's because the masterchain is primarily used for voting or storing libraries. If you don't need to partake in those things, you don't need to enable masterchain support.

:::

If you really do need masterchain support, the simplest and recommended approach is to modify a [`tact.config.json`](/book/config) file in the root of your project (or create it if it didn't exist yet), and [set the `masterchain` property to `true{:json}`](/book/config#options-masterchain).

If you're working on a [Blueprint][bp]-based project, you can enable masterchain support in the compilation configs of your contracts, which are located in a directory named `wrappers/`:

```typescript title="wrappers/YourContractName.compile.ts" {7}
import { CompilerConfig } from '@ton/blueprint';

export const compile: CompilerConfig = {
  lang: 'tact',
  target: 'contracts/your_contract_name.tact',
  options: {
    masterchain: true, // ← that's the stuff!
  }
};
```

However, [`tact.config.json`](/book/config) may still be used in [Blueprint][bp] projects. In such cases values specified in [`tact.config.json`](/book/config) act as default unless modified in the `wrappers/`.
