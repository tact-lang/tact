Contracts in Tact are similar to classes in popular object-oriented languages, except that their instances are deployed on the blockchain and they can't be passed around like [Structs and Messages](/book/structs-and-messages).

## Self-references {#self}

Contracts and [traits][trait] have a built-in [identifier](/book/expressions#identifiers) `self{:tact}`, which is used for referring to their fields (persistent state [variables](#variables) and [constants](#variables)) and methods ([internal functions](#internal-functions)):

```tact
contract Example {
    // persistent state variables
    foo: Int;

    init() {
        self.foo = 42; // <- referencing variable foo through self.
    }
}
```

## Structure

Each contract can contain:

* [Inherited traits](#traits)
* [Supported interfaces](#interfaces)
* [Persistent state variables](#variables)
* [Constructor function `init(){:tact}`](#init-function)
* [Contract constants](#constants)
* [Getter functions](#getter-functions)
* [Receiver functions](#receiver-functions)
* [Internal functions](#internal-functions)

### Inherited traits, `with{:tact}` {#traits}

Contracts can inherit all the declarations and definitions from [traits][trait] and override some of their default behaviours. In addition to that, every contract and trait implicitly inherits the special [`BaseTrait{:tact}` trait](/ref/core-base).

To inherit a [trait][trait], specify its name after the keyword `with{:tact}` in contract's declaration. To inherit multiple traits at once, specify their names in a comma-separated list with an optional trailing comma.

```tact /with/
trait InheritMe {}
trait InheritMeToo {}

// A contract inheriting a single trait
contract Single with InheritMe {}

// A contract inheriting multiple traits
contract Plural with
    InheritMe,
    InheritMeToo, // trailing comma is allowed
{}
```

As [traits][trait] are not allowed to have [`init(){:tact}` function](#init-function), a contract inheriting a trait with any [persistent state variables](#variables) declared must initialize them by providing its own [`init(){:tact}` function](#init-function).

```tact
trait Supe { omelander: Bool }

contract Vot with Supe {
    init() {
        self.omelander = true;
    }
}
```

If declared or defined in a trait, internal functions and constants can be marked as [virtual or abstract](/book/functions#virtual-and-abstract-functions) and overridden in contracts inheriting from the trait.

### Supported interfaces, `@interface(…)` {#interfaces}

It's hard to figure out what a contract does and what [receivers](#receiver-functions) and [getters](#getter-functions) it has without looking at its source code. Sometimes the source is unavailable or inaccessible, and all that's left is to try to disassemble the contract and introspect it that way, which is a very messy and error-prone approach with diminishing returns and no real reproducibility.

In order to resolve this issue, an [OTP-001: Supported Interfaces](/ref/evolution/otp-001) was created. In accordance to it, Tact contracts [can report](/book/config#options-interfacesgetter) the list of supported interfaces as a return value of a special `supported_interfaces` [getter](#getter-functions). That getter is accessible off-chain using any TON Blockchain explorer — one just needs to specify `supported_interfaces` as a method to execute and get a list of hexadecimal values in return.

These hexadecimal values are truncated to the first 128 bit of [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Hash_standard) hashes of the original [`String{:tact}`][p] values of the supported interfaces. The first value in this list **must** be equal to $\mathrm{0x5cec3d5d2cae7b1e84ec39d64a851b66}$ in [hexadecimal notation](/book/integers#hexadecimal), which is the first half of the SHA-256 hash for `"org.ton.introspection.v0"{:tact}`. If the first value is wrong, you must stop trying to introspect the contract, as it doesn't conform to the [Supported Interfaces](/ref/evolution/otp-001) proposal.

To declare support of a certain interface, add one or more `@interface("…"){:tact}` attributes right before contract and [trait][trait] declarations:

```tact
@interface("His name is")
@interface("John")
contract SeeNah with Misc {
    // ...
}

@interface("name_of_your_org - miscellaneous")
trait Misc {
    // ...
}
```

Tact has a small set of interfaces provided under specific conditions:

* `"org.ton.abi.ipfs.v0"{:tact}`, in accordance to [OTP-003: Self-ABI Reporting](/ref/evolution/otp-003) — opt-in via [`ipfsAbiGetter`](/book/config#options-ipfsabigetter) config property
* `"org.ton.deploy.lazy.v0"{:tact}`, in accordance to [OTP-005: Argument-addressable contracts](/ref/evolution/otp-005)
* `"org.ton.debug.v0"{:tact}`, but only if [debug mode](/book/debug#debug-mode) is enabled
* `"org.ton.chain.any.v0"{:tact}` if [masterchain](/book/masterchain) support is enabled, and `"org.ton.chain.workchain.v0"{:tact}` otherwise

Some [traits][trait] in [standard libraries](/ref/standard-libraries) define their interfaces too:

* [`Ownable{:tact}`](/ref/stdlib-ownable#ownable) trait specifies `"org.ton.ownable"{:tact}`
* [`OwnableTransferable{:tact}`](/ref/stdlib-ownable#ownabletransferable) trait specifies `"org.ton.ownable.transferable.v2"{:tact}`
* [`Stoppable{:tact}`](/ref/stdlib-stoppable#stoppable) trait specifies `"org.ton.stoppable"{:tact}`
* [`Resumable{:tact}`](/ref/stdlib-stoppable#resumable) trait specifies `"org.ton.resumable"{:tact}`

To enable `supported_interfaces` [getter](#getter-functions) generation and use `@interface(){:tact}` attribute in your Tact contracts, modify a [`tact.config.json`](/book/config) file in the root of your project (or create it if it didn't exist yet), and [set the `interfacesGetter` property to `true{:json}`](/book/config#options-interfacesgetter).

If you're working on a [Blueprint][bp]-based project, you can enable `supported_interfaces` in the compilation configs of your contracts, which are located in a directory named `wrappers/`:

```typescript title="wrappers/YourContractName.compile.ts" {7}
import { CompilerConfig } from '@ton/blueprint';

export const compile: CompilerConfig = {
  lang: 'tact',
  target: 'contracts/your_contract_name.tact',
  options: {
    interfacesGetter: true, // ← that's the stuff!
  }
};
```

In addition to that, [`tact.config.json`](/book/config) may still be used in [Blueprint][bp] projects. In such cases values specified in [`tact.config.json`](/book/config) act as default unless modified in the `wrappers/`.

:::note

  If you have the `separateCompilables` option set to `true{:typescript}` in the [`blueprint.config.ts`][bp-config], then the `.compile.ts` files will be located in the `compilables/` directory and **not** in `wrappers/`.

:::

:::caution

  Be aware that adding an interface does not guarantee that the contract actually implements any particular functionality, or that it implements it in any particular way. It's just an off-chain, verifiable promise that a contract _might_ have some specific code in it. It's up to you to trust, but verify, such claims.

  In addition, there is no guarantee that there won't be name clashes between different interfaces, although they are unlikely because even the first 128 bits of SHA-256 provide sufficient [collision resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance).

:::

### Persistent state variables {#variables}

Contracts can define state variables that persist between contract calls. Contracts in TON [pay rent](https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/fees#storage-fee) in proportion to the amount of persistent space they consume, so [compact representations via serialization](/book/integers#serialization) are encouraged.

```tact
contract Example {
    // persistent state variables
    val: Int;              // Int
    val32: Int as uint32;  // Int serialized to an 32-bit unsigned
    mapVal: map<Int, Int>; // Int keys to Int values
    optVal: Int?;          // Int or null
}
```

State variables must have a default value or initialized in [`init(){:tact}`](#init-function) function, that runs on deployment of the contract. The only exception is persistent state variables of type [`map<K, V>{:tact}`](/book/maps) since they are initialized empty by default.

:::note

  Note, that Tact supports local, non-persistent-state variables too, see: [Variable declaration](/book/statements#let).

:::

### Contract constants {#constants}

Unlike [variables](#variables), constants cannot change. Their values are calculated in _compile-time_ and cannot change during execution.

There isn't much difference between constants defined outside of a contract (global constants) and inside the contract (contract constants). Those defined outside can be used by other contracts in your project.

Constant initializations must be relatively simple and only rely on values known during compilation. If you add two numbers for example, the compiler will calculate the result during build and put the result in your compiled code.

You can read constants both in [receivers](#receiver-functions) and in [getters](#getter-functions).

Unlike [contract variables](#variables), **contract constants don't consume space in persistent state**. Their values are stored directly in the code [`Cell{:tact}`](/book/cells#cells) of the contract.

```tact
// global constants are calculated in compile-time and cannot change
const GlobalConst1: Int = 1000 + ton("42") + pow(10, 9);

contract Example {
    // contract constants are also calculated in compile-time and cannot change
    const ContractConst1: Int = 2000 + ton("43") + pow(10, 9);

    // contract constants can be an easy alternative to enums
    const StateUnpaid: Int = 0;
    const StatePaid: Int = 1;
    const StateDelivered: Int = 2;
    const StateDisputed: Int = 3;

    get fun sum(): Int {
        // access constants from anywhere
        return GlobalConst1 + self.ContractConst1 + self.StatePaid;
    }
}
```

Read more about constants on their dedicated page: [Constants](/book/constants).

### Constructor function `init()` {#init-function}

On deployment of the contract, the constructor function `init(){:tact}` is run.

If a contract has any [persistent state variables](#variables) without default values specified, it must initialize them in this function.

```tact
contract Example {
    // persistent state variables
    var1: Int = 0; // initialized with default value 0
    var2: Int;     // must be initialized in the init() function

    // constructor function
    init() {
        self.var2 = 42;
    }
}
```

If a contract doesn't have any persistent state variables, or they all have their default value specified, it may omit the `init(){:tact}` function declaration altogether. That's because unless explicitly declared, the empty `init(){:tact}` function is present by default in all contracts.

The following is an example of a valid empty contract:

```tact
contract IamEmptyAndIKnowIt {}
```

For your convenience, parameter list of `init(){:tact}` can have a trailing comma:

```tact
contract TheySeeMeTrailing {
    init(
        param1: Int,
        param2: Int, // trailing comma is allowed
    ) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

:::note

  To obtain initial state of the target contract in [internal functions](#internal-functions), [receivers](#receiver-functions) or [getters](#getter-functions) use [`initOf{:tact}`](/book/expressions#initof) expression.

:::

### Getter functions

[Getter functions](/book/functions#getter-functions) are **not accessible from other contracts and exported only to off-chain world**.

Additionally, **getters cannot modify the contract's state variables**, only read their values and use them in expressions.

```tact
contract HelloWorld {
    foo: Int;

    init() {
        self.foo = 0;
    }

    // getter function with return type Int
    get fun foo(): Int {
        return self.foo; // can't change self.foo here
    }
}
```

Read more about them in their dedicated section: [Getter functions](/book/functions#getter-functions)

### Receiver functions

[Receiver functions](/book/functions#receiver-functions) in Tact can be one of the following three kinds:

* [`receive(){:tact}`](/book/receive), which receive internal messages (from other contracts).
* [`bounced(){:tact}`](/book/bounced), which are called when outgoing message from this contract has bounced back.
* [`external(){:tact}`](/book/external), which don't have a sender and can be sent by anyone in the world.

```tact
message CanBounce {
    counter: Int;
}

contract HelloWorld {
    counter: Int;

    init() {
        self.counter = 0;
    }

    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }

    // internal message receiver, which responds to a string message "increment"
    receive("increment") {
        self.counter += 1;

        // sending the message back to the sender
        send(SendParameters{
            to: sender(),
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors,
            body: CanBounce{counter: self.counter}.toCell(),
        });
    }

    // bounced message receiver, which is called when the message bounces back to this contract
    bounced(src: bounced<MsBounced>) {
        self.counter = 0; // reset the counter in case message bounced
    }

    // external message receiver, which responds to off-chain message "hello, it's me"
    external("hello, it's me") {
        // can't be replied to as there's no sender!
        self.counter = 0;
    }
}
```

Naming a parameter of the receiver function with an underscore `_{:tact}` makes its value considered unused and discarded. This is useful when you don't need to inspect the message received and you only want it to convey a specific opcode:

```tact
message(42) UniverseCalls {}

contract Example {
    receive(_: UniverseCalls) {
        // Got a Message with opcode 42
    }
}
```

### Internal functions

These functions behave similarly to private methods in popular object-oriented languages — they're internal to contracts and can be called by prefixing them with a special [identifier `self{:tact}`](#self). That's why internal functions can sometimes be referred to as "contract methods".

Internal functions can access the contract's [persistent state variables](#variables) and [constants](#constants).

They can only be called from [receivers](#receiver-functions), [getters](#getter-functions) and other internal functions, but not from other contracts or [`init(){:tact}`](#init-function).

```tact
contract Functions {
    val: Int = 0;

    // this contract method can only be called from within this contract and access its variables
    fun onlyZeros() {
        require(self.val == 0, "Only zeros are permitted!");
    }

    // receiver function, which calls the internal function onlyZeros
    receive("only zeros") {
        self.onlyZeros();
    }
}
```

:::note

  Note, that Tact supports other kinds of functions too, see: [Functions](/book/functions).
