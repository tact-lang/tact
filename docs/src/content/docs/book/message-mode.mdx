As it was previously mentioned, messages are sent with the `mode` param of a struct `SendParameters{:tact}`. It's an [`Int{:tact}`][int] value, which is combined from base modes and optional flags, which are also [`Int{:tact}`][int] values.

It's possible to use raw [`Int{:tact}`][int] values and manually provide them for the `mode`, but for your convenience there's a set of constants which you may use to construct the compound `mode` with ease. Take a look at the following tables for more information on base modes and optional flags.

## Base modes

Mode value | Constant name                 | Description
---------: | :---------------------------- | -----------
$0$        | -                             | Ordinary message (default).
$64$       | `SendRemainingValue{:tact}`   | Carry all the remaining value of the inbound message in addition to the value initially indicated in the new message.
$128$      | `SendRemainingBalance{:tact}` | Carry all the remaining balance of the current smart contract instead of the value originally indicated in the message.

## Optional flags

Flag value | Constant name                   | Description
---------: | :------------------------------ | -----------
$+1$       | `SendPayGasSeparately{:tact}`   | Pay forward fees separately from the message value.
$+2$       | `SendIgnoreErrors{:tact}`       | Ignore any errors arising while processing this message during the action phase.
$+16$      | `SendBounceIfActionFail{:tact}` | Bounce transaction in case of any errors during action phase. Has no effect if flag $+2$, `SendIgnoreErrors{:tact}` is used.
$+32$      | `SendDestroyIfZero{:tact}`      | Current account must be destroyed if its resulting balance is zero (often used with mode $128$, `SendRemainingBalance{:tact}`).

## Combining modes with flags

To make the [`Int{:tact}`][int] value for `mode` field of `SendParameters{:tact}`, you just have to combine base modes with optional flags by applying the [bitwise OR](/book/operators#binary-bitwise-or) operation.

For example, if you want to send a regular message and pay transfer fees separately, use the mode $0$ (default) and a flag $+1$ to get `mode` $= 1$, which is equal to using `SendPayGasSeparately{:tact}` constant.

Alternatively, if you want to send the whole contract balance and destroy it immediately, use the mode $128$ and flag $+32$ to get `mode` $= 160$, which is equal to `SendRemainingBalance | SendDestroyIfZero{:tact}`.

Here's how the latter example would look in code:

```tact
let to: Address = ...;
let value: Int = ton("1");
send(SendParameters{
    to: to,
    value: value,
    mode: SendRemainingBalance | SendDestroyIfZero,
    body: "Hello, World!".asComment(),
});
```

:::caution

  Note, that while adding ([`+{:tact}`](/book/operators#binary-add)) base modes together with optional flags is possible, it is discouraged due to the possibility of excess values. Use the bitwise OR ([`|{:tact}`](/book/operators#binary-bitwise-or)) instead, as it's designed to work with such flag and bit manipulations of the `mode`.

:::note

  Also note, that there can be only one [base mode](#base-modes), but number of [optional flags](#optional-flags) may vary: you can use them all, none or just some.
