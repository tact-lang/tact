import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

As previously mentioned, messages sent via the [`send(){:tact}`](/ref/core-send#send) function utilize the `mode` parameter of the `SendParameters{:tact}` structure. The `mode` is an [`Int{:tact}`][int] value, which is combined from base modes and optional flags, which are also [`Int{:tact}`][int] values.

It's possible to use raw [`Int{:tact}`][int] values and manually provide them for the `mode`, but for your convenience there is a set of constants you may use to easily construct the compound `mode`. Take a look at the following tables for more information on base modes and optional flags.

Note that there are other [message-sending functions](/book/send#message-sending-functions) â€” they do not use the `SendParameters{:tact}` [struct](/book/structs-and-messages#structs), but accept the `mode` as one of their parameters.

## Base modes

Mode value | Constant name                 | Description
---------: | :---------------------------- | -----------
$0$        | <Badge text="Since Tact 1.6" variant="tip"/> `SendDefaultMode{:tact}` | Ordinary message (default).
$64$       | `SendRemainingValue{:tact}`   | Carries all the remaining value of the inbound message in addition to the value initially indicated in the new message.
$128$      | <Badge text="Use with caution" title="Careless use can result in a total balance loss" variant="danger"/> `SendRemainingBalance{:tact}` | Carries **all the remaining balance** of the current smart contract instead of the value originally indicated in the message.
$1024$     | <Badge text="Since Tact 1.5" variant="tip"/> `SendOnlyEstimateFee{:tact}` | Doesn't send the message, only estimates the forward fees if the [message-sending function](/book/send#message-sending-functions) computes these.

The base mode `SendRemainingValue{:tact}` does **not** take previous actions into account, i.e., it doesn't recalculate the remaining value of the incoming message based on previously sent messages or actions performed during the [action phase](https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview#transactions-and-phases).

Unlike `SendRemainingValue{:tact}`, the base mode `SendRemainingBalance{:tact}` always calculates the current value of the contract balance, which can help solve problems with [complex outbound message processing](/book/send#outbound-message-processing).

However, be **very** careful when using `SendRemainingBalance{:tact}`, because it works with the balance of the entire contract, and any mistake with it can lead to a total loss of funds.

## Optional flags

Flag value | Constant name                   | Description
---------: | :------------------------------ | -----------
$+1$       | `SendPayGasSeparately{:tact}`   | Pay [forward fees][fwdfee] separately from the message value.
$+2$       | `SendIgnoreErrors{:tact}`       | Ignore any errors arising while processing this message during the action phase.
$+16$      | `SendBounceIfActionFail{:tact}` | Bounce the transaction in case of any errors during the action phase. Has no effect if flag $+2$, `SendIgnoreErrors{:tact}`, is used.
$+32$      | `SendDestroyIfZero{:tact}`      | The current account (contract) will be destroyed if its resulting balance is zero. This flag is often used with mode $128$, `SendRemainingBalance{:tact}`.

## Combining modes with flags

To create the [`Int{:tact}`][int] value for the `mode` field of `SendParameters{:tact}`, you simply combine a base mode with optional flags using the [bitwise OR](/book/operators#binary-bitwise-or) operation.

For example, if you want to send a regular message and pay transfer fees separately, use the default mode $0$ and add flag $+1$ to obtain `mode = 1`, which is equivalent to using the constant `SendPayGasSeparately{:tact}`.

Alternatively, if you want to send the entire contract balance and destroy it immediately, use mode $128$ and add flag $+32$ to get `mode = 160`, which is equivalent to `SendRemainingBalance | SendDestroyIfZero{:tact}`.

Here's how the latter example would look in code:

```tact
let to: Address = address("...");
let value: Int = ton("1");
send(SendParameters{
    to: to,
    value: value,
    mode: SendRemainingBalance | SendDestroyIfZero,
    body: "Hello, World!".asComment(),
});
```

Note that there can be only **one** [base mode](#base-modes), but the number of [optional flags](#optional-flags) may vary: you can use all, none, or only some of them.

:::caution

  While adding ([`+{:tact}`](/book/operators#binary-add)) base modes together with optional flags is possible, it is discouraged due to the possibility of obtaining incorrect values. Instead, use the [bitwise OR `|{:tact}`](/book/operators#binary-bitwise-or), as it is specifically designed for correctly combining flags and performing bit manipulations of the `mode`.

## Functions with implicit mode

Some [message-sending functions](/book/send#message-sending-functions) do not allow setting a mode by passing an argument. This is because their internal logic requires a specific fixed set of modes to be used instead:

* [`emit(){:tact}`](/ref/core-send#emit) sends a message with the `SendDefaultMode{:tact}` ($0$).
* [`self.reply(){:tact}`](/ref/core-base#self-reply), [`self.notify(){:tact}`](/ref/core-base#self-notify), and [`self.forward(){:tact}`](/ref/core-base#self-forward) all use the `SendRemainingValue{:tact}` mode unless the [`self.storageReserve{:tact}`](/ref/core-base#self-storagereserve) constant is overridden to be greater than $0$, in which case they attempt to use the `SendRemainingBalance{:tact}` mode.
