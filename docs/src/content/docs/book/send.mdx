TON Blockchain is message-based — to communicate with other contracts and to deploy new ones you need to send messages.

Messages in Tact are commonly composed using a built-in [Struct](/book/structs-and-messages#structs) `SendParameters{:tact}`, which consists of:

Field    | Type                   | Description
:------- | :--------------------- | :----------
`bounce` | [`Bool{:tact}`][p]     | When set to `true` (default) message bounces back to the sender if the receiver contract doesn't exist or wasn't able to process the message.
`to`     | [`Address{:tact}`][p]  | Receiver internal [`Address{:tact}`][p] in TON blockchain.
`value`  | [`Int{:tact}`][int]    | The amount of [nanoToncoins][nano] you want to send with the message. This value is usually used to cover [forward fees][fwdfee], unless the optional flag [`SendPayGasSeparately{:tact}`](/book/message-mode#optional-flags) is used.
`mode`   | [`Int{:tact}`][int]    | An 8-bit value that configures how to send a message, defaults to $0$. See: [Message `mode`](/book/message-mode).
`body`   | [`Cell?{:tact}`][cell] | [Optional][opt] message body as a [`Cell{:tact}`][cell]
`code`   | [`Cell?{:tact}`][cell] | [Optional][opt] initial code of the contract (the compiled bytecode)
`data`   | [`Cell?{:tact}`][cell] | [Optional][opt] initial data of the contract (arguments of [`init(){:tact}` function](/book/contracts#init-function) of the contract)

Fields `code` and `data` are what's called an [init package](/book/expressions#initof), which is used in deployments of new contracts.

## Send simple reply

The simplest message is a reply to the incoming message returning all excess value of a message:

```tact
self.reply("Hello, World!".asComment()); // asComment converts a String to a Cell with a comment
```

## Send message

If you need more advanced logic you can use the `send(){:tact}` function and `SendParameters{:tact}` [Struct](/book/structs-and-messages#structs) directly.

In fact, the previous example with [`.reply(){:tact}`](#send-simple-reply) can be made using the following call to `send(){:tact}` function:

```tact
send(SendParameters{
    // bounce is set to true by default
    to: sender(), // sending message back to the sender
    value: 0, // don't add Toncoins to the message...
    mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors, // ...except for ones received from the sender due to SendRemainingValue
    body: "Hello, World".asComment(), // asComment converts a String to a Cell with a comment
});
```

Another example sends a message to the specified [`Address{:tact}`][p] with a `value` of $1$ TON and the `body` of a comment with a [`String{:tact}`][p] `"Hello, World!"{:tact}`:

```tact
let recipient: Address = address("...");
let value: Int = ton("1");
send(SendParameters{
    // bounce is set to true by default
    to: recipient,
    value: value,
    mode: SendIgnoreErrors, // will send the message despite any errors
    body: "Hello, World!".asComment(),
});
```

The [optional flag](/book/message-mode#optional-flags) `SendIgnoreErrors{:tact}` means that if an error occurs during [message send](#outbound-message-processing), it will be ignored and the given message will be skipped. Message-related [action phase][phases] [exit codes](/book/exit-codes) that might be thrown without the `SendIgnoreErrors{:tact}` set are:

* $36$: [`Invalid destination address in outbound message`](/book/exit-codes#36)
* $37$: [`Not enough Toncoin`](/book/exit-codes#37)
* $39$: [`Outbound message doesn't fit into a cell`](/book/exit-codes#39)
* $40$: [`Cannot process a message`](/book/exit-codes#40)

## Send typed message

To send a typed message you can use the following code:

```tact
let recipient: Address = address("...");
let value: Int = ton("1");
send(SendParameters{
    // bounce is set to true by default
    to: recipient,
    value: value,
    mode: SendIgnoreErrors, // don't stop in case of errors
    body: SomeMessage{arg1: 123, arg2: 1234}.toCell(),
});
```

## Deploy contract

To deploy a contract you need to calculate its address and initial state with [`initOf{:tact}`](/book/expressions#initof), then send them in the initialization message:

```tact
let init: StateInit = initOf SecondContract(arg1, arg2);
let address: Address = contractAddress(init);
let value: Int = ton("1");
send(SendParameters{
    // bounce is set to true by default
    to: address,
    value: value,
    mode: SendIgnoreErrors, // don't stop in case of errors
    code: init.code,
    data: init.data,
    body: "Hello, World!".asComment(), // not necessary, can be omitted
});
```

## Outbound message processing

Each transaction on TON Blockchain consists of [multiple phases][phases]. Outbound messages are evaluated in [compute phase][compute], but are **not** sent in that phase. Instead, they're queued for execution in the [action phase][phases] in order of their appearance in the compute phase.

Outgoing message sends may fail in [action phase][phases] due to insufficient [action fees](https://docs.ton.org/develop/howto/fees-low-level#action-fee) or [forward fees][fwdfee], in which case they won't bounce and **won't revert** the transaction. This can happen because all values are calculated in the [compute phase][compute], all fees are computed by the end of it, and exceptions do not roll back the transaction during the action phase.

To skip or ignore the queued messages at the [action phase][phases] in case they cannot be sent, set the optional [`SendIgnoreErrors{:tact}`](/book/message-mode#optional-flags) flag when composing the message.

Consider the following example:

```tact
// This contract initially has 0 nanoToncoins on the balance
contract FailureIsNothingButAnotherStep {
    // And all the funds it gets are obtained from inbound internal messages
    receive() {
        // 1st outbound message evaluated and queued (but not yet sent)
        send(SendParameters{
            to: sender(),
            value: ton("0.042"), // plus forward fee due to SendPayGasSeparately
            mode: SendIgnoreErrors | SendPayGasSeparately,
            // body is null by default
        });

        // 2nd outbound message evaluated and queued,
        // but not yet sent, and never will be!
        send(SendParameters{
            to: sender(),
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors,
            // body is null by default
        });
    } // exit code 37 during action phase!
}
```

There, the second message won't actually be sent:

* After finishing the [compute phase][compute], the remaining value $\mathrm{R}$ of the contract is computed.

* During the outbound message processing and assuming that there was enough value provided in the inbound message, the first message leaves $\mathrm{R} - (0.042 + \mathrm{forward\_fees})$ [nanoToncoins][nano] on the balance.

* When the second message is processed, contract tries to send $\mathrm{R}$ [nanoToncoins][nano], but fails to do so because there is already a smaller amount left.

* Thus, an error with [exit code 37](/book/exit-codes#37) is thrown: `Not enough Toncoin`.

Note that such failures are not exclusive to the [`send(){:tact}`](/ref/core-common#send) function and may also occur when using other [message-sending functions](#message-sending-functions).

For instance, let's replace the first call to the [`send(){:tact}`](/ref/core-common#send) function in the previous example with the [`emit(){:tact}`](/ref/core-common#emit) function. The latter queues the message using the default mode, i.e. $0$, and spends some [nanoToncoins][nano] to pay the [forward fees][fwdfee].

If a subsequent message is then sent with a [`SendRemainingValue{:tact}`](/book/message-mode#base-modes) base mode, it will cause the same error as before:

```tact
// This contract initially has 0 nanoToncoins on the balance
contract IfItDiesItDies {
    // And all the funds it gets are obtained from inbound internal messages
    receive() {
        // 1st outbound message evaluated and queued (but not yet sent)
        // with the mode 0, which is the default
        emit("Have you seen this message?".asComment());

        // 2nd outbound message evaluated and queued,
        // but not yet sent, and never will be!
        send(SendParameters{
            to: sender(),
            value: 0,
            bounce: false, // brave and bold
            mode: SendRemainingValue,
            body: "Not this again!".asComment(),
        });
    } // exit code 37 during action phase!
}
```

:::note

  To avoid dealing with similar cases and to simplify future [debugging sessions](/book/debug), consider having only one call to one of the [message-sending functions](#message-sending-functions) per [receiver function](/book/receive).

  Alternatively, see the suggested solutions below.

:::

Previous examples discussed a case where the contract has $0$ [nanoToncoins][nano] on the balance, which is rather rare — in most real-world scenarios there would be some funds present. As such, it's usually better to use the [`SendRemainingBalance{:tact}`](/book/message-mode#base-modes) base mode, paired with the _necessary_ call to the [`nativeReserve(){:tact}`](/ref/core-advanced#nativereserve) function.

Like outbound messages, [reserve requests](/ref/core-advanced#nativereserve) are queued during the [compute phase][compute] and executed during the [action phase][phases].

```tact
// This contract has some Toncoins on the balance, say, 0.2 or more
contract MyPrecious {
    // The extra funds can be received via a "topup" message
    receive("topup") {}

    // And the rest of the logic is expressed here
    receive() {
        // 1st outbound message evaluated and queued (but not yet sent)
        // with the mode 0, which is the default
        emit("Have you seen this message?".asComment());

        // Let's try to keep the most out of the balance prior to this transaction
        // Notice that nativeReserve() only queues an action to be performed during action phase
        nativeReserve(ton("0.05"), ReserveAtMost | ReserveAddOriginalBalance);
        //            -----------  -------------   -------------------------
        //            ↑            ↑               ↑
        //            |            |               keeping the balance from before the compute phase start
        //            |            might keep less, but won't fail in doing so
        //            just a tad more on top of the balance, for the fees

        // 2nd outbound message evaluated and queued
        // with the SendRemainingBalance mode
        send(SendParameters{
            to: sender(),
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingBalance, // because of the prior nativeReserve(),
                                        // using this mode is safe and we'll keep
                                        // the original balance plus a little more
            body: "I give you my all! Well, all that's not mine!".asComment(),
        });
    }
}
```

Instead, if you want all outgoing messages to preserve a fixed amount of funds on the balance and **send the rest of the balance**, consider using one of the following functions instead. Note that they require a prior override of the [`self.storageReserve{:tact}`](/ref/core-base#self-storagereserve) constant:

* [`self.reply(){:tact}`](/ref/core-base#self-reply)
* [`self.notify(){:tact}`](/ref/core-base#self-notify)
* [`self.forward(){:tact}`](/ref/core-base#self-forward)

If you take only one thing away from this section, please remember this: be very careful with the [base modes](/book/message-mode#base-modes) of the message-sending functions, including the [implicitly set modes](/book/message-mode#functions-with-implicit-mode).

## Message sending limits

In total, there could be no more than $255$ actions queued for execution, which means that the maximum allowed number of messages sent per transaction is $255$.

Attempts to queue more throw an exception with an [exit code 33](/book/exit-codes#33) during [action phase][phases]: `Action list is too long`.
