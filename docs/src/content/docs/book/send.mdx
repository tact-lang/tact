TON blockchain is message-based — to communicate with other contracts and to deploy new ones you need to send messages.

Messages in Tact are commonly composed using a built-in [Struct](/book/structs-and-messages#structs) `SendParameters{:tact}`, which consists of:

Field    | Type                   | Description
:------- | :--------------------- | :----------
`bounce` | [`Bool{:tact}`][p]     | When set to `true` (default) message bounces back to the sender if the receiver contract doesn't exist or wasn't able to process the message.
`to`     | [`Address{:tact}`][p]  | Receiver internal [`Address{:tact}`][p] in TON blockchain.
`value`  | [`Int{:tact}`][int]    | The amount of [nanoToncoins][nano] you want to send with the message. This value is usually used to cover [forward fees][fwdfee], unless the optional flag [`SendPayGasSeparately{:tact}`](/book/message-mode#optional-flags) is used.
`mode`   | [`Int{:tact}`][int]    | An 8-bit value that configures how to send a message, defaults to $0$. See: [Message `mode`](/book/message-mode).
`body`   | [`Cell?{:tact}`][cell] | [Optional][opt] message body as a [`Cell{:tact}`][cell]
`code`   | [`Cell?{:tact}`][cell] | [Optional][opt] initial code of the contract (the compiled bytecode)
`data`   | [`Cell?{:tact}`][cell] | [Optional][opt] initial data of the contract (arguments of [`init(){:tact}` function](/book/contracts#init-function) of the contract)

Fields `code` and `data` are what's called an [init package](/book/expressions#initof), which is used in deployments of new contracts.

## Send simple reply

The simplest message is a reply to the incoming message returning all excess value of a message:

```tact
self.reply("Hello, World!".asComment()); // asComment converts a String to a Cell with a comment
```

## Send message

If you need more advanced logic you can use the `send(){:tact}` function and `SendParameters{:tact}` [Struct](/book/structs-and-messages#structs) directly.

In fact, the previous example with [`.reply(){:tact}`](#send-simple-reply) can be made using the following call to `send(){:tact}` function:

```tact
send(SendParameters{
    // bounce is set to true by default
    to: sender(), // sending message back to the sender
    value: 0, // don't add Toncoins to the message...
    mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors, // ...except for ones received from the sender due to SendRemainingValue
    body: "Hello, World".asComment(), // asComment converts a String to a Cell with a comment
});
```

Another example sends a message to the specified [`Address{:tact}`][p] with a `value` of $1$ TON and the `body` of a comment with a [`String{:tact}`][p] `"Hello, World!"{:tact}`:

```tact
let recipient: Address = address("...");
let value: Int = ton("1");
send(SendParameters{
    // bounce is set to true by default
    to: recipient,
    value: value,
    mode: SendIgnoreErrors, // will send the message despite any errors
    body: "Hello, World!".asComment(),
});
```

The [optional flag](/book/message-mode#optional-flags) `SendIgnoreErrors{:tact}` means that even when an error occurs during message sending next messages would be sent anyway. **No error during the sending phase would revert a transaction.**

## Send typed message

To send a binary typed message you can use the following code:

```tact
let recipient: Address = address("...");
let value: Int = ton("1");
send(SendParameters{
    // bounce is set to true by default
    to: recipient,
    value: value,
    mode: SendIgnoreErrors, // don't stop in case of errors
    body: SomeMessage{arg1: 123, arg2: 1234}.toCell(),
});
```

## Deploy contract

To deploy a contract you need to calculate its address and initial state with [`initOf{:tact}`](/book/expressions#initof), then send them in the initialization message:

```tact
let init: StateInit = initOf SecondContract(arg1, arg2);
let address: Address = contractAddress(init);
let value: Int = ton("1");
send(SendParameters{
    // bounce is set to true by default
    to: address,
    value: value,
    mode: SendIgnoreErrors, // don't stop in case of errors
    code: init.code,
    data: init.data,
    body: "Hello, World!".asComment(), // not necessary, can be omitted
});
```

## Outbound message processing

Each transaction on TON Blockchain consists of [multiple phases][phases]. Outbound messages are evaluated in [compute phase][compute], but are **not** sent in that phase. Instead, they're queued in order of appearance for the [action phase][phases], where all actions listed in [compute phase][compute], like outbound messages or [reserve requests](/ref/core-advanced#nativereserve), are executed.

As all the values are computed in [compute phase][compute], all the fees computed by the end of it, and exceptions do not revert the transaction during [action phase][phases], outbound message sends can fail without bounce due to unsufficient [action fees](https://docs.ton.org/develop/howto/fees-low-level#action-fee) or [forward fees][fwdfee].

Consider the following example:

```tact
// This contract initially has 0 nanoToncoins on the balance
contract FailureIsNothingButAnotherStep {
    // And all the funds it gets are obtained from inbound internal messages
    receive() {
        // 1st outbound message evaluated and queued (but not sent yet)
        send(SendParameters{
            to: sender(),
            value: ton("0.042"), // plus forward fee due to SendPayGasSeparately
            mode: SendIgnoreErrors | SendPayGasSeparately,
        });

        // 2nd outbound message evaluated and queued (but not sent yet, and never will be!)
        send(SendParameters{
            to: sender(),
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors,
        });
    }
}
```

There, the second message won't actually be sent:

* After finishing the [compute phase][compute], the remaining value $\mathrm{R}$ of the contract is computed.

* During the outbound message processing and assuming that there was enough value provided in the inbound message, the first message leaves $\mathrm{R} - (0.042 + \mathrm{forward\_fees})$ [nanoToncoins](/book/integers#nanotoncoin) on the balance.

* When the second message is processed, contract tries to send $\mathrm{R}$ [nanoToncoins](/book/integers#nanotoncoin), but fails to do so because there is already a smaller amount left.
