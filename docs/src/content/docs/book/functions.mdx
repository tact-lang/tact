Functions in Tact could be defined in different ways:

* Global static function
* Extension functions
* Mutation functions
* Native functions
* [Assembly functions](#asm)
* [Internal functions](/book/contracts#internal-functions)
* Receiver functions
* Getter functions

All functions, except for [receiver functions](#receiver-functions) can have a trailing comma in their definitions (parameter lists) and calls (argument lists):

```tact
fun foo(
    a: Int, // trailing comma in parameter lists is allowed
) {}

fun bar() {
    foo(
        5, // trailing comma in argument lists is allowed too!
    );
}
```

## Global static functions

You can define global function anywhere in your program:

```tact
fun customPow(a: Int, c: Int): Int {
  let res: Int = 1;
  repeat(c) {
    res *= a;
  }
  return res;
}
```

## Virtual and abstract functions

You can allow the contract inheriting a [traits](/book/types#traits) to modify an internal function, if it has the `virtual{:tact}` keyword, using `override{:tact}`. The function can be also marked as `abstract{:tact}`, in which case the inheriting contract has to define its implementation:

```tact
trait FilterTrait with Ownable {
    // Virtual functions can be overridden by users of this trait
    virtual fun filterMessage(): Bool {
        return sender() != self.owner;
    }

    abstract fun specialFilter(): Bool;
}

contract Filter with FilterTrait {
    // Overriding default behavior of the FilterTrait
    override fun filterMessage(): Bool {
        return true;
    }

    override fun specialFilter(): Bool {
        return true;
    }
}
````

## Extension function

Extension functions allow you to implement extensions for any possible type.

> **Warning**
> The name of the first argument MUST be named `self` and the type of this argument is the type you are extending.

```tact
extends fun customPow(self: Int, c: Int): Int {
    let res: Int = 1;
    repeat(c) {
        res *= self;
    }
    return res;
}
```

## Mutation functions

Mutation functions are performing mutation of a value replacing it with an execution result. To perform mutation, the function must change the `self` value.

```tact
extends mutates fun customPow(self: Int, c: Int) {
    let res: Int = 1;
    repeat(c) {
        res *= self;
    }
    self = res;
}
```

## Native functions

Native functions are direct bindings of FunC functions:

> **Note**
> Native functions could also be mutation and extension ones.

```tact
@name(store_uint)
native storeUint(s: Builder, value: Int, bits: Int): Builder;

@name(load_int)
extends mutates native loadInt(self: Slice, l: Int): Int;
```

## Assembly functions, `asm` {#asm}

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.5" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

Read more about them on their dedicated page: [Assembly functions](/book/assembly-functions).

## Receiver functions

Receiver functions are special functions that are responsible for receiving messages in contracts and could be defined only within a contract or trait.

```tact
contract Treasure {
    // This means that this contract can receive the comment "Increment" and this function would be called for such messages
    receive("Increment") {
        self.counter += 1;
    }
}
```

## Getter Functions

Getter functions define getters on smart contracts and can be defined only within a contract or trait.
Getter functions cannot be used to read some other contract's state: if you need to obtain some data you need to do that by sending a message with a request and define a receiver which would process the request answer.

```tact
contract Treasure {
    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }
}
```

### Explicit resolution of method ID collisions

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.6 (not released yet)" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

Like other functions in TON contracts, getters have their _unique_ associated function selectors, which are $19$-bit signed integer identifiers commonly called _method IDs_.

Method IDs of getters are derived from their names using the [CRC16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) algorithm as follows: `(crc16(<function_name>) & 0xffff) | 0x10000`. In addition, Tact compiler conditionally reserves some method IDs for use in [getters of supported interfaces](/book/contracts#interfaces), namely: $113617$ for `supported_interfaces`, $115390$ for `lazy_deployment_completed`, and $121275$ for `get_abi_ipfs`.

Sometimes, getters with different names end up with the same method ID. If this happens, you can either rename some of the getters or manually specify the method ID as a [compile-time](/ref/core-comptime) expression like so:

```tact
contract ManualMethodId {
    const methodId: Int = 16384 + 42;

    get(self.methodId)
    fun methodId1(): Int {
        return self.methodId;
    }

    get(crc32("crc32") + 42 & 0x3ffff | 0x4000)
    fun methodId2(): Int {
        return crc32("crc32") + 42 & 0x3ffff | 0x4000;
    }
}
```

Unlike getters, method IDs for [internal functions](/book/contracts#internal-functions) and some special functions are obtained sequentially: integers in the inclusive range from $-4$ to $0$ are given to [certain message handlers](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/functions#special-function-names), while internal functions are numbered with method IDs starting at $1$ and going up to $2^{14} - 1$ inclusive.

Since method IDs are $19$-bit signed integers and some of them are reserved, only the inclusive ranges from $-2^{18}$ to $-5$ and from $2^{14}$ to $2^{18} - 1$ are free to be used by users. To avoid collisions, it's recommended to specify method IDs only in these ranges, avoiding the method IDs of Tact-specific getters mentioned above.
