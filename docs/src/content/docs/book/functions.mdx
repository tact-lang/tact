Functions in Tact could be defined in different ways:

* Global static function
* Extension functions
* Mutable functions
* Native functions
* Receiver functions
* Getter functions

All functions, except for [receiver functions](#receiver-functions) can have a trailing comma in their definitions (parameter lists) and calls (argument lists):

```tact
fun foo(
    a: Int, // trailing comma in parameter lists is allowed
) {}

fun bar() {
    foo(
        5, // trailing comma in argument lists is allowed too!
    );
}
```

## Global static functions

You can define global function anywhere in your program:

```tact
fun customPow(a: Int, c: Int): Int {
  let res: Int = 1;
  repeat(c) {
    res *= a;
  }
  return res;
}
```

## Virtual and abstract functions

You can allow the contract inheriting a [traits](/book/types#traits) to modify an internal function, if it has the `virtual{:tact}` keyword, using `override{:tact}`. The function can be also marked as `abstract{:tact}`, in which case the inheriting contract has to define its implementation:

```tact
trait FilterTrait with Ownable {
    // Virtual functions can be overridden by users of this trait
    virtual fun filterMessage(): Bool {
        return sender() != self.owner;
    }

    abstract fun specialFilter(): Bool;
}

contract Filter with FilterTrait {
    // Overriding default behavior of the FilterTrait
    override fun filterMessage(): Bool {
        return true;
    }

    override fun specialFilter(): Bool {
        return true;
    }
}
````

## Extension function

Extension functions allow you to implement extensions for any possible type.

> **Warning**
> The name of the first argument MUST be named `self` and the type of this argument is the type you are extending.

```tact
extends fun customPow(self: Int, c: Int): Int {
    let res: Int = 1;
    repeat(c) {
        res *= self;
    }
    return res;
}
```

## Mutable functions

Mutable functions are performing mutation of a value replacing it with an execution result. To perform mutation, the function must change the `self` value.

```tact
extends mutates fun customPow(self: Int, c: Int) {
    let res: Int = 1;
    repeat(c) {
        res *= self;
    }
    self = res;
}
```

## Native functions

Native functions are direct bindings of FunC functions:

> **Note**
> Native functions could be also mutable and extension ones.

```tact
@name(store_uint)
native storeUint(s: Builder, value: Int, bits: Int): Builder;

@name(load_int)
extends mutates native loadInt(self: Slice, l: Int): Int;
```

## Receiver functions

Receiver functions are special functions that are responsible for receiving messages in contracts and could be defined only within a contract or trait.

```tact
contract Treasure {
    // This means that this contract can receive the comment "Increment" and this function would be called for such messages
    receive("Increment") {
        self.counter += 1;
    }
}
```

## Getter Functions

Getter functions define getters on smart contracts and can be defined only within a contract or trait.
Getter functions cannot be used to read some other contract's state: if you need to obtain some data you need to do that by sending a message with a request and define a receiver which would process the request answer.

```tact
contract Treasure {
    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }
}
```

### Explicit resolution of method ID collisions

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.6" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

As other functions in TVM contracts, getters have their *unique* associated function selectors which are some integers ids (called *method IDs*).
Some of those integers are reserved for internal purposes, e.g. -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 are reserved IDs and 
regular functions (internal to a contract and not callable from outside) are usually numbered by subsequent (small) integers starting from 1.
By default, getters have associated method IDs that are derived from their names using the [CRC16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) algorithm as follows:
`crc16(<function_name>) & 0xffff) | 0x10000`.
Sometimes this can get you the same method ID for getters with different names.
If this happens, you can either rename some of the contract's getters or
specify the getter's method ID manually as a compile-time expression like so:

```tact
contract ManualMethodId {
    const methodId: Int = 16384 + 42;

    get(self.methodId) fun methodId1(): Int {
        return self.methodId;
    }

    get(crc32("crc32") + 42 & 0x3ffff | 0x4000)
    fun methodId2(): Int {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Note that you *cannot* use method IDs that are reserved by TVM and you cannot use some initial positive integers because those will be used as function selectors by the compiler.

User-specified method IDs are 19-bit signed integers, so you can use integers from $-2^{18}$ to $-5$ and from $2^{14}$ to $2^{18} - 1$.

Also, a few method IDs are reserved for the usage by the getters the Tact compiler can insert during compilation, those are 113617, 115390, 121275.
