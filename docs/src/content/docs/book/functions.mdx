Functions in Tact could be defined in different ways:

* Global static function
* Extension functions
* Mutable functions
* Native functions
* Receiver functions
* Getter functions

All functions, except for [receiver functions](#receiver-functions) can have a trailing comma in their definitions (parameter lists) and calls (argument lists):

```tact
fun foo(
    a: Int, // trailing comma in parameter lists is allowed
) {}

fun bar() {
    foo(
        5, // trailing comma in argument lists is allowed too!
    );
}
```

## Global static functions

You can define global function anywhere in your program:

```tact
fun customPow(a: Int, c: Int): Int {
  let res: Int = 1;
  repeat(c) {
    res *= a;
  }
  return res;
}
```

## Virtual and abstract functions

You can allow the contract inheriting a [traits](/book/types#traits) to modify an internal function, if it has the `virtual{:tact}` keyword, using `override{:tact}`. The function can be also marked as `abstract{:tact}`, in which case the inheriting contract has to define its implementation:

```tact
trait FilterTrait with Ownable {
    // Virtual functions can be overridden by users of this trait
    virtual fun filterMessage(): Bool {
        return sender() != self.owner;
    }

    abstract fun specialFilter(): Bool;
}

contract Filter with FilterTrait {
    // Overriding default behavior of the FilterTrait
    override fun filterMessage(): Bool {
        return true;
    }

    override fun specialFilter(): Bool {
        return true;
    }
}
````

## Extension function

Extension functions allow you to implement extensions for any possible type.

> **Warning**
> The name of the first argument MUST be named `self` and the type of this argument is the type you are extending.

```tact
extends fun customPow(self: Int, c: Int): Int {
    let res: Int = 1;
    repeat(c) {
        res *= self;
    }
    return res;
}
```

## Mutable functions

Mutable functions are performing mutation of a value replacing it with an execution result. To perform mutation, the function must change the `self` value.

```tact
extends mutates fun customPow(self: Int, c: Int) {
    let res: Int = 1;
    repeat(c) {
        res *= self;
    }
    self = res;
}
```

## Native functions

Native functions are direct bindings of FunC functions:

> **Note**
> Native functions could be also mutable and extension ones.

```tact
@name(store_uint)
native storeUint(s: Builder, value: Int, bits: Int): Builder;

@name(load_int)
extends mutates native loadInt(self: Slice, l: Int): Int;
```

## Receiver functions

Receiver functions are special functions that are responsible for receiving messages in contracts and could be defined only within a contract or trait.

```tact
contract Treasure {
    // This means that this contract can receive the comment "Increment" and this function would be called for such messages
    receive("Increment") {
        self.counter += 1;
    }
}
```

## Getter Functions

Getter functions define getters on smart contracts and can be defined only within a contract or trait.

```tact
contract Treasure {
    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }
}
```
