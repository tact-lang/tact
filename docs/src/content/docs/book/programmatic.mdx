title: Programmatic API
---

You can invoke the Tact compiler from your code in node and browser environments.

:::caution

  This API has not been released yet. It will be released in the 1.0.0 version.

:::

## Run compiler in browser

```ts
import { run } from "@tact-lang/compiler";

// Virtual FS
const fs = {
  ["main.tact"]: Buffer.from("...").toString("base64"),
};

const config = {
  projects: [
    {
      name: "Sample",
      path: "main.tact",
      output: "./output",
    },
  ],
};

// Run compiler
let successful = await run({ config, fs });

// NOTE: Output from is written to the same fs object.
```

## Contract verification

You can always verify the compiled package with the `verify` function.

```ts
import { verify } from "@tact-lang/compiler";
const pkg: string = '...';
const res = await verify(pkg);
```
