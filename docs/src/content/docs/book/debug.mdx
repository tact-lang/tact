Without fail, the code we write as smart contract developers doesn't always do what we expect it to do. Sometimes it does something completely different! When the unexpected happens, the next task is to figure out why. To do so, there are various ways to reveal problems or "bugs" in the code. Let's get to _debugging_!

## General approach {#approach}

At the moment, Tact doesn't have a step-through debugger. Despite that, it's still possible to use the ["printf debugging"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging#printf_debugging) approach.

This involves actively placing [`dump(){:tact}`][dump] and [`dumpStack(){:tact}`](/ref/core-debug#dumpstack) function calls throughout your code and observing the states of variables at a given point in time. Note that these functions work only in [debug mode](#debug-mode) and won't be executed otherwise.

:::note

  See how to use [`dump(){:tact}`][dump] for debugging: [Debug with `dump(){:tact}`](#tests-dump).

:::

In addition to dumping values, it's often helpful to use assertive functions like [`require(){:tact}`](/ref/core-debug#require), [`throwIf(){:tact}`](/ref/core-debug#throwif), and [`throwUnless(){:tact}`](/ref/core-debug#throwunless). They help clearly state your assumptions and are handy for setting up "trip wires" for catching issues in the future.

If you can't find or resolve the cause of your issues, try asking the community in Tact's [Telegram chat][tg], or if your issue or question is generally related to TON more than to Tact, hop into the [TON Dev Telegram chat](https://t.me/tondev_eng).

## Common debugging functions {#debug-functions}

Tact provides a handful of various functions useful for debugging: [Core library → Debug](/ref/core-debug).

## Enabling debug mode in compilation options {#debug-mode}

In order to make certain functions like [`dump(){:tact}`][dump] or [`dumpStack(){:tact}`](/ref/core-debug#dumpstack) work, you need to enable debug mode.

:::note

  Make sure to disable debug mode in production, as the [`dump(){:tact}`][dump] and [`dumpStack(){:tact}`](/ref/core-debug#dumpstack) functions are very gas-expensive and should only be used for local debugging.

:::

The simplest and recommended approach is to modify the [`tact.config.json`](/book/config) file in the root of your project (or create it if it doesn't exist yet) and [set the `debug` property to `true{:json}`](/book/config#options-debug).

If you're working on a [Blueprint][bp]-based project, you can enable debug mode in the compilation configs of your contracts, which are located in a directory named `wrappers/`:

```typescript title="wrappers/YourContractName.compile.ts" {7}
import { CompilerConfig } from '@ton/blueprint';

export const compile: CompilerConfig = {
  lang: 'tact',
  target: 'contracts/your_contract_name.tact',
  options: {
    debug: true, // ← that's the stuff!
  }
};
```

Note that versions of [Blueprint][bp] starting with 0.20.0 automatically enable debug mode in `wrappers/` for new contracts.

In addition to that, [`tact.config.json`](/book/config) may still be used in [Blueprint][bp] projects. In such cases, values specified in [`tact.config.json`](/book/config) act as defaults unless modified in the `wrappers/`.

:::note

  If you have the `separateCompilables` option set to `true{:typescript}` in the [`blueprint.config.ts`][bp-config], then the `.compile.ts` files will be located in the `compilables/` directory and **not** in `wrappers/`.

:::

:::note

  Read more about configuration and the [`tact.config.json`](/book/config) file: [Configuration](/book/config).\
  See how to use [`dump(){:tact}`][dump] for debugging: [Debug with `dump(){:tact}`](#tests-dump).

:::

## Writing tests in Blueprint, with Sandbox and Jest {#tests}

The [Blueprint][bp] is a popular development framework for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on TON Blockchain.

For testing smart contracts, it uses the [Sandbox][sb], a local TON Blockchain emulator, and [Jest][jest], a JavaScript testing framework.

Whenever you create a new [Blueprint][bp] project or use the `blueprint create` command inside an existing project, it creates a new contract along with a test suite file for it.

Those files are placed in the `tests/` folder and executed with [Jest][jest]. By default, all tests run unless you specify a specific group or test closure. For other options, refer to the brief documentation in the Jest CLI: `jest --help`.

### Structure of test files {#tests-structure}

Let's say we have a contract named `Playground`, written in the `contracts/playground.tact` file. If we've created that contract through [Blueprint][bp], it also created a `tests/Playground.spec.ts` test suite file for us.

The test file contains a single `describe(){:typescript}` [Jest][jest] function call, which denotes a test group.

Inside that group, you'll have three variables available in all tests within:

* `blockchain` — a local blockchain instance provided by [Sandbox][sb]
* `deployer` — a TypeScript wrapper used for deploying our `Playground` contract or any other we'd like to deploy
* `playground` — a TypeScript wrapper for our `Playground` contract

:::note

  It is a common mistake to update `.tact` code and run tests without making a build first. That's because tests in [Blueprint][bp] rely on [TypeScript wrappers](#tests-wrappers) generated by the Tact compiler and work with the latest build made.

  That is why every time you make a change to your Tact code, make sure to build it with `npx blueprint build` before you execute the test suite. For your convenience, you may combine builds and tests into a single command, as shown in the [experimental lab setup](#lab-4).

:::

Then, a `beforeEach(){:tact}` [Jest][jest] function is called — it specifies all the code to be executed before each of the subsequent test closures.

:::note

  It is strongly advised not to modify the contents of `beforeEach(){:tact}` unless you really need specific behavior for each test closure or the parameters of your [`init(){:tact}`](/book/contracts#init-function) function have changed.

  Additionally, you may need to edit the contents of `beforeEach(){:tact}` if you've changed the [contract parameters](/book/contracts#parameters).

:::

Finally, each test closure is described with a call to the `it(){:tact}` [Jest][jest] function—that's where tests are actually written.

The simplest example of a test closure can look like this:

```typescript
it('should deploy', async () => {
  // The check is done inside beforeEach, so this can be empty
});
```

### Debug with `dump()` {#tests-dump}

:::note

  Calling [`dump(){:tact}`][dump] is computationally expensive and consumes a lot of gas. Be sure to always supply enough Toncoin in your tests to avoid [exit code -14](/book/exit-codes#-14).

:::

To see the results of [`dump(){:tact}`][dump] function calls and use the ["printf debugging"](#approach) approach, one has to:

1. Put calls to [`dump(){:tact}`][dump] and other [common debugging functions](#debug-functions) in relevant places within the code.
2. Run [Jest][jest] tests, which will call the target functions and send messages to the target receivers.

Assuming you've created a [new counter contract project](/#start), let's see how it works in practice.

First, let's place a call to [`dump(){:tact}`][dump] in `contracts/simple_counter.tact`, which will output the `amount` passed in the `msg{:tact}` [Struct][struct] to the contract's debug console:

```tact title="contracts/simple_counter.tact" {3}
// ...
receive(msg: Add) {
    dump(msg.amount);
    // ...
}
// ...
```

Next, let's comment out all existing `it(){:typescript}` test closures in the `tests/SimpleCounter.spec.ts` file. Then add the following one:

```typescript title="tests/SimpleCounter.spec.ts"
it('should dump', async () => {
  await playground.send(
    deployer.getSender(),
    { value: toNano('0.5') },
    { $$type: 'Add', queryId: 1n, amount: 1n },
  );
});
```

It sends a message to our contract's `receive(msg: Add){:tact}` [receiver](/book/receive) without storing the [results of such send](#tests-send).

Now, if we build our contract with `yarn build{:shell}` and run our test suite with `yarn test{:shell}`, we'll see the following in the test logs:

```txt
console.log
  #DEBUG#: [DEBUG] File contracts/simple_counter.tact:17:9
  #DEBUG#: 1

    at SmartContract.runCommon (node_modules/@ton/sandbox/dist/blockchain/SmartContract.js:221:21)
```

This output is produced by our [`dump(){:tact}`][dump] call above.

:::note

  Read more about sending messages to contracts in tests: [Send messages to contracts](#tests-send).

:::

### State expectations with `expect()` {#tests-expect}

An integral part of writing tests is ensuring that your expectations match the observed reality. For that, [Jest][jest] provides a function `expect(){:tact}`, which is used as follows:

1. First, an observed variable is provided.
2. Then, a specific method is called to check a certain property of that variable.

Here's a more involved example, which uses the `expect(){:tact}` function to check that a counter contract properly increases the counter:

```typescript
it('should increase counter', async () => {
  const increaseTimes = 3;
  for (let i = 0; i < increaseTimes; i++) {
    console.log(`increase ${i + 1}/${increaseTimes}`);

    const increaser = await blockchain.treasury('increaser' + i);

    const counterBefore = await simpleCounter.getCounter();
    console.log('counter before increasing', counterBefore);

    const increaseBy = BigInt(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100));
    console.log('increasing by', increaseBy);

    const increaseResult = await simpleCounter.send(
      increaser.getSender(),
      { value: toNano('0.05') },
      { $$type: 'Add', queryId: 0n, amount: increaseBy }
    );

    expect(increaseResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
      from: increaser.address,
      to: simpleCounter.address,
      success: true,
    });

    const counterAfter = await simpleCounter.getCounter();
    console.log('counter after increasing', counterAfter);

    expect(counterAfter).toBe(counterBefore + increaseBy);
  }
});
```

  [Testing flow (FunC)](https://github.com/ton-org/sandbox/blob/main/docs/testing-key-points.md)\

:::

### Utility methods {#tests-jest-utils}

Test files generated by [Blueprint][bp] import the `@ton/test-utils` library, which provides access to a number of additional helper methods for the result type of the `expect(){:typescript}` function from [Jest][jest]. Note that regular methods like `toEqual(){:typescript}` are still there and ready to be used.

#### toHaveTransaction

The method `expect(…).toHaveTransaction(){:typescript}` checks that the list of transactions contains a transaction matching certain properties you specify:

```typescript {2}
const res = await yourContractName.send(…);
expect(res.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
  // For example, let's check that a transaction to your contract was successful:
  to: yourContractName.address,
  success: true,
});
```

To know the full list of such properties, look at the auto-completion options provided by your editor or IDE.

#### toEqualCell

The method `expect(…).toEqualCell(){:typescript}` checks the equality of two [cells](/book/cells#cells):

```typescript {3}
expect(oneCell).toEqualCell(anotherCell);
```

#### toEqualSlice

The method `expect(…).toEqualSlice(){:typescript}` checks the equality of two [slices](/book/cells#slices):

```typescript {3}
expect(oneSlice).toEqualSlice(anotherSlice);
```

#### toEqualAddress

The method `expect(…).toEqualAddress(){:typescript}` checks the equality of two [addresses](/book/types#primitive-types):

```typescript {3}
expect(oneAddress).toEqualAddress(anotherAddress);
```

### Interacting with TypeScript wrappers {#tests-wrappers}

Upon successful compilation, the Tact compiler produces a `.ts` file that includes all necessary [TypeScript wrappers](/book/compile#wrap-ts) for easy interaction with a compiled contract. You can use them in tests, deployment scripts, or elsewhere.

Some of the most commonly used generated utility functions, structural types, classes, and constants are described below.

For more, see: [TypeScript wrappers on the Compilation page](/book/compile#wrap-ts).

#### Structures and corresponding (de)composition functions {#wrappers-structs}

All the [structs][struct] and [message structs][message] observable in the [compilation report](/book/compile#structures) are provided as new `type` definitions.

For each such definition, there are corresponding `storeStructureName(){:ts}` and `loadStructureName(){:ts}` functions to help compose and parse cells from these structures.

```typescript
// The following import path is relevant for Blueprint projects,
// but your mileage may vary — check your output/ or build/ folders for exact paths.
import { StateInit, loadStateInit, storeStateInit } from '../wrappers/MyContract';
import { beginCell } from '@ton/core';

let si1: StateInit = {
  $$type: 'StateInit',
  code: beginCell().endCell(),
  data: beginCell().endCell(),
};

// Storing StateInit, mutating the passed Builder
let b = beginCell();
storeStateInit(si1)(b);

// Loading StateInit, mutating the passed Slice
let s = b.asSlice();
let si2 = loadStateInit(s);

// They are equal
si1.code === si2.code;
si1.data === si2.data;
```

#### Contract wrapper class {#wrappers-contract}

The contract wrapper class provides convenient methods to send messages and call getters. It also exposes contract constants, a [record of error string messages to exit code numbers](#wrappers-exit-codes), and a [record of all message opcodes](#wrappers-opcodes).

```typescript
// MyContract is a contract class in the generated TypeScript bindings.
// The following import path is relevant for Blueprint projects,
// but your mileage may vary — check your output/ or build/ folders for exact paths.
import { MyContract } from '../wrappers/MyContract';
import { NetworkProvider } from '@ton/blueprint';
import { toNano } from '@ton/core';

// The main function of each script in Blueprint projects
export async function run(provider: NetworkProvider) {
  // Creating an instance of MyContract with no initial data
  const myContract = provider.open(await MyContract.fromInit());

  // Deploying it via a simple message with `null` body
  await myContract.send(
    provider.sender(),
    { value: toNano('0.05') },
    null,
  );
  await provider.waitForDeploy(myContract.address);

  // Now, let's call some getter
  await myContract.getGas();
}
```

#### Bidirectional access for exit codes {#wrappers-exit-codes}

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.6.1" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

You can access two records that mirror each other: a `ContractName_errors` record, which maps [exit code](/book/exit-codes) numbers to their error message strings, and a `ContractName_errors_backward` record, which does the opposite — maps the error message strings to the exit code numbers. Organized this way, they provide convenient bidirectional access to exit codes.

Both records only feature the standard exit codes reserved by TON Blockchain and Tact compiler and those generated by [`require(){:tact}`](/ref/core-debug#require) function. If you define some custom exit codes as global or contract constants, those will be exported separately.

Additionally, you can access the `ContractName_errors_backward` record through the static field `ContractName.errors`.

```typescript {10}
// MyContract is a contract class in the generated TypeScript bindings.
// The following import path is relevant for Blueprint projects,
// but your mileage may vary — check your output/ or build/ folders for exact paths.
import {
  MyContract, // contract class
  MyContract_errors, // record of exit code numbers to error string messages
  MyContract_errors_backward, // record of error string messages to exit code numbers
} from '../wrappers/MyContract';

// ...somewhere down in the body of the `it()` test closure...
expect(MyContract_errors[37]).toBe("Not enough Toncoin");
expect(receipt.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
  from: walletV5.address,
  to: myContract, // instance of MyContract
  actionResultCode: MyContract_errors_backward['Not enough Toncoin'], // 37
});

// Similar to the previous `toHaveTransaction()` check,
// but now uses the static field instead of the global record
expect(receipt.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
  from: walletV5.address,
  to: myContract, // instance of MyContract
  actionResultCode: myContract.errors['Not enough Toncoin'], // 37
});
```

Only the standard [exit codes](/book/exit-codes) reserved by TON Blockchain and Tact compiler and those generated by [`require(){:tact}`](/ref/core-debug#require) are present in those records. If you define some custom exit codes as global or contract constants, those will be exported separately.

```typescript title="tact_MyContract.ts" {2,7}
// Global constant
export const CUSTOM_CONSTANT_NAME = 42n;

export class MyContract implements Contract {
    // Constants declared in the contract or its inherited traits
    public static readonly storageReserve = 0n;

    // ...
}
```

#### Message opcodes {#wrappers-opcodes}

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.6.1" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

Through the static field `ContractName.opcodes` you can access opcodes of [message structs][message] that are declared or imported directly in the contract code and those exposed from the Core standard library.

```typescript {10}
// MyContract is a contract class in the generated TypeScript bindings.
// The following import path is relevant for Blueprint projects,
// but your mileage may vary — check your output/ or build/ folders for exact paths.
import { MyContract } from '../wrappers/MyContract';

// ...somewhere down in the body of the `it()` test closure...
expect(receipt.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
  from: walletV5.address,
  to: escrowContract, // instance of MyContract
  op: escrowContract.opcodes.Funding, // 2488396969 (or 0x9451eca9 in hex)
});
```

## Send messages to contracts {#tests-send}

To send messages to contracts, use the `.send(){:typescript}` method on their [TypeScript wrappers](/book/compile#wrap-ts) like so:

```typescript
// It accepts 3 arguments:
await yourContractName.send(
  // 1. sender of the message
  deployer.getSender(), // this is a default treasury, can be replaced

  // 2. value and (optional) bounce, which is true by default
  { value: toNano('0.5'), bounce: false },

  // 3. a message body, if any
  'Look at me!',
);
```

The message body can be a simple string or an object specifying fields of the [Message](/book/structs-and-messages#messages) type:

```typescript {4-8}
await yourContractName.send(
  deployer.getSender(),
  { value: toNano('0.5') },
  {
    $$type: 'NameOfYourMessageType',
    field1: 0n, // bigint zero
    field2: 'yay',
  },
);
```

More often than not, it's important to store the results of such sends because they contain events that occurred, transactions made, and external messages sent:

```typescript
const res = await yourContractName.send(…);
// res.events — array of events occurred
// res.externals — array of external-out messages
// res.transactions — array of transactions made
```

With that, we can easily filter or check certain transactions:

```typescript
expect(res.transactions).toHaveTransaction(…);
```

### Observe the fees and values {#tests-fees}

[Sandbox][sb] provides a helper function `printTransactionFees(){:typescript}`, which pretty-prints all the values and fees used in the provided transactions. It is quite handy for observing the flow of [nanoToncoins](/book/integers#nanotoncoin).

To use it, modify the imports from `@ton/sandbox` at the top of the test file:

```typescript
import { Blockchain, SandboxContract, TreasuryContract, printTransactionFees } from '@ton/sandbox';
//                                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Then, provide an array of transactions as an argument, like so:

```typescript
printTransactionFees(res.transactions);
```

To work with individual values of total fees or fees from the compute and action [phases](https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview#transactions-and-phases), inspect each transaction individually:

```typescript {11,17,21}
// Storing the transaction handled by the receiver in a separate constant
const receiverHandledTx = res.transactions[1];
expect(receiverHandledTx.description.type).toEqual('generic');

// Needed to please TypeScript
if (receiverHandledTx.description.type !== 'generic') {
  throw new Error('Generic transaction expected');
}

// Total fees
console.log('Total fees: ', receiverHandledTx.totalFees);

// Compute fee
const computeFee = receiverHandledTx.description.computePhase.type === 'vm'
  ? receiverHandledTx.description.computePhase.gasFees
  : undefined;
console.log('Compute fee: ', computeFee);

// Action fee
const actionFee = receiverHandledTx.description.actionPhase?.totalActionFees;
console.log('Action fee: ', actionFee);

// Now we can do some involved checks, like limiting the fees to 1 Toncoin
expect(
  (computeFee ?? 0n)
  + (actionFee ?? 0n)
).toBeLessThanOrEqual(toNano('1'));
```

:::note

  [Sandbox][sb] has many more utility functions that are often handy. For example, it provides `prettyLogTransaction(){:typescript}` and `prettyLogTransactions(){:typescript}`, which operate on a single or multiple transactions respectively, and pretty-print the flow of values between addresses.

:::

### Transactions with intentional errors {#tests-errors}

Sometimes it's useful to perform negative tests featuring intentional errors and throwing specific [exit codes](/book/exit-codes).

An example of such a [Jest][jest] test closure in [Blueprint][bp]:

```typescript title="tests/YourTestFileHere.spec.ts" {9,15}
it('throws specific exit code', async () => {
  // Send a specific message to our contract and store the result
  const res = await your_contract_name.send(
    deployer.getSender(),
    {
      value: toNano('0.5'), // value in nanoToncoins sent
      bounce: true,         // (default) bounceable message
    },
    'the message your receiver expects', // ← change it to yours
  );

  // Expect the transaction to our contract to fail with a certain exit code
  expect(res.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
    to: your_contract_name.address,
    exitCode: 5, // ← change it to yours
  });
});
```

Note that to track down transactions with a certain exit code, you only need to specify the `exitCode` field in the object argument to the `toHaveTransaction(){:typescript}` method of `expect(){:typescript}`.

However, it's useful to narrow the scope by specifying the recipient address `to`, so that Jest looks only at the transaction caused by our message to the contract.

### Simulate passage of time {#tests-time}

The Unix time in local blockchain instances provided by [Sandbox][bp] starts at the moment of their creation in the `beforeEach(){:typescript}` block.

```typescript {2}
beforeEach(async () => {
  blockchain = await Blockchain.create(); // ← here
  // ...
});
```

Previously, we've been warned not to modify the `beforeEach(){:typescript}` block unless we really need to. Now, we must override the time and travel a little forward.

Let's add the following line at the end of it, explicitly setting `blockchain.now` to the time when the deployment message was handled:

```typescript {3}
beforeEach(async () => {
  // ...
  blockchain.now = deployResult.transactions[1].now;
});
```

Now, we can manipulate time in our test clauses. For example, let's make a transaction one minute after deployment and another one after two minutes:

```typescript {2,4}
it('your test clause title', async () => {
  blockchain.now += 60; // 60 seconds later
  const res1 = await yourContractName.send(…);
  blockchain.now += 60; // another 60 seconds later
  const res2 = await yourContractName.send(…);
});
```

## Logging via `emit` {#logging}

A [global static function](/book/functions#global-static-functions) [`emit(){:tact}`](/ref/core-send#emit) sends a message to the outer world — it doesn't have a specific recipient.

This function is very handy for logging and analyzing data off-chain — one just has to look at [external messages](/book/external) produced by the contract.

### Logs in local Sandbox tests {#logging-local}

When deploying in the [Sandbox][sb], you may call [`emit(){:tact}`](/ref/core-send#emit) from a [receiver function](/book/contracts#receiver-functions) and then observe the list of sent [external messages](/book/external):

```typescript {9-10}
it('emits', async () => {
  const res = await simpleCounter.send(
    deployer.getSender(),
    { value: toNano('0.05') },
    'emit_receiver', // ← change to the message your receiver handles
  );

  console.log("Address of our contract: " + simpleCounter.address);
  console.log(res.externals); // ← here you would see results of emit() calls,
                              //   and all external messages in general
});
```

### Logs of a deployed contract {#logging-deployed}

Every transaction on TON Blockchain [contains `out_msgs`](https://docs.ton.org/develop/data-formats/transaction-layout#transaction) — a dictionary that holds the list of outgoing messages created during the transaction execution.

To see logs from [`emit(){:tact}`](/ref/core-send#emit) in that dictionary, look for external messages without a recipient. In various TON Blockchain explorers, such transactions will be marked as `external-out` with the destination specified as `-` or `empty`.

Note that some explorers deserialize the message body sent for you, while others don't. However, you can always [parse it yourself](#logging-parsing) locally.

### Parsing the body of the emitted message {#logging-parsing}

Consider the following example:

```tact
// We have a Struct
struct Ballroom {
    meme: Bool;
    in: Int;
    theory: String;
}

// And a simple contract,
contract Bonanza {
    // which can receive a String message,
    receive("time to emit") {
        // emit a String
        emit("But to the Supes? Absolutely diabolical.".asComment());

        // and a Struct
        emit(Ballroom{meme: true, in: 42, theory: "Duh"}.toCell());
    }
}
```

Now, let's make a simple [test clause](#tests-structure) for the `Bonanza` contract:

```typescript /bonanza/
it('emits', async () => {
  const res = await bonanza.send(
    deployer.getSender(),
    { value: toNano('0.05') },
    'time to emit',
  );
});
```

Here, the `res` object would contain the list of sent [external messages](/book/external) as its `externals` field. Let's access it to parse the first message sent via a call to [`emit(){:tact}`](/ref/core-send#emit) in Tact code (or _emitted_ for short):

```typescript /body/
it('emits', async () => {
  // ... prior code ...

  // We'll need only the body of the observed message:
  const firstMsgBody = res.externals[0].body;

  // Now, let's parse it, knowing it's a text message.
  // NOTE: In a real-world scenario,
  //       you'd want to check that first or wrap this in a try...catch
  const firstMsgText = firstMsgBody.asSlice().loadStringTail();

  // "But to the Supes? Absolutely diabolical."
  console.log(firstMsgText);
});
```

To parse the second emitted message, we could manually use several `.loadSomething(){:typescript}` functions, but that's overly brittle — if the fields of the `Ballroom{:tact}` [Struct][struct] ever change, you'd need to start all over. That could significantly backfire when you have numerous tests written in that manner.

Fortunately, the Tact compiler auto-generates [TypeScript bindings (or wrappers)](/book/compile#wrap-ts) for contracts, making it easy to reuse them in your test suite. Not only do they provide wrappers for the contract you're testing, but they also export helper functions to store or load [Structs][struct] and [Messages][message] defined in the contract. These helper functions have names similar to their corresponding [Structs][struct] and [Messages][message], prefixed with `load`.

For example, in our case, we'll need a function called `loadBallroom(){:typescript}`, to parse a [`Slice{:tact}`][slice] into the `Ballroom{:tact}` [Struct][struct] in TypeScript. To import it, either type the name and let your IDE suggest auto-importing it for you, or look at the top of your test suite file — there should be a similar line:

```typescript
import { Bonanza } from '../wrappers/Bonanza';
//              ^ here you could import loadBallroom
```

With that, let's parse the second emitted message:

```typescript
it('emits', async () => {
  // ... prior code ...

  // We'll need only the body of the observed message:
  const secondMsgBody = res.externals[1].body;

  // Now, let's parse it, knowing it's the Ballroom Struct.
  // NOTE: In a real-world scenario,
  //       you'd want to check that first or wrap this in a try...catch
  const secondMsgStruct = loadBallroom(secondMsgBody.asSlice());

  // { '$$type': 'Ballroom', meme: true, in: 42n, theory: 'Duh' }
  console.log(secondMsgStruct);
});
```

Note that it's also possible to parse emitted messages of deployed contracts outside of our test suite. You would simply need to obtain the emitted message bodies and use the auto-generated TypeScript bindings from Tact alongside the `@ton/core` library, just like we've done in the examples above.

## Handling bounced messages {#bounced}

When [sent](/book/send) with `bounce: true{:tact}`, messages can bounce back in case of errors. Make sure to write the relevant [`bounced(){:tact}`](/book/bounced) message [receivers](/book/contracts#receiver-functions) and handle bounced messages gracefully:

```tact
bounced(msg: YourMessage) {
    // ...alright squad, let's bounce!...
}
```

Keep in mind that bounced messages in TON have only 224 usable data bits in their message body and do not have any references, so one cannot recover much data from them. However, you still get to see whether the message has bounced or not, allowing you to create more robust contracts.

Read more about bounced messages and receivers: [Bounced messages](/book/bounced).

## Experimental lab setup {#lab}

If you're overwhelmed by the testing setup of [Blueprint][bp] or just want to test some things quickly, worry not — there is a way to set up a simple playground as an experimental lab to test your ideas and hypotheses.

<Steps>

1. #### Create a new Blueprint project {#lab-1}

   This will prevent pollution of your existing project with arbitrary code and tests.

   The new project can be named anything, but we'll name it `Playground` to convey its intended purpose.

   To create it, run the following command:

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="yarn" icon="seti:yarn">
       ```shell
       # recommended
       yarn create ton tact-playground --type tact-empty --contractName Playground
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">
       ```shell
       npm create ton@latest -- tact-playground --type tact-empty --contractName Playground
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
       ```shell
       pnpm create ton@latest tact-playground --type tact-empty --contractName Playground
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="bun" icon="bun">
       ```shell
       bun create ton@latest tact-playground --type tact-empty --contractName Playground
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   Versions of [Blueprint][bp] starting with 0.20.0 automatically enable debug mode in `wrappers/` for new contracts, so we only have to adjust the testing suite and prepare our `Playground` contract for testing.

2. #### Update the test suite {#lab-2}

   Move into the newly created `tact-playground/` project, and in the file `tests/Playground.spec.ts`, change the `"should deploy"{:tact}` test closure to the following:

   ```typescript title="tests/Playground.spec.ts"
   it('plays', async () => {
     const res = await playground.send(
       deployer.getSender(),
       { value: toNano('0.5') }, // ← here you may increase the value in nanoToncoins sent
       'plays',
     );

     console.log("Address of our contract: " + playground.address);
     console.log(res.externals); // ← here one would see results of emit() calls
   });
   ```

3. #### Modify the contract {#lab-3}

   Replace the code in `contracts/playground.tact` with the following:

   ```tact title="contracts/playground.tact" {9-11}
   contract Playground {
       // Empty receiver for the deployment
       receive() {
	         // Forward the remaining value in the
           // incoming message back to the sender
           cashback(sender());
       }

       receive("plays") {
           // NOTE: write your test logic here!
       }
   }
   ```

   The basic idea of this setup is to place the code you want to test into the [receiver function](/book/contracts#receiver-functions) responding to the [string](/book/types#primitive-types) message `"plays"{:tact}`.

   Note that you can still write any valid Tact code outside of that [receiver](/book/contracts#receiver-functions), but in order to test it, you'll need to write related test logic inside it.

4. #### Let's test! {#lab-4}

   With that, our experimental lab setup is complete. To execute that single test we've prepared for our `Playground` contract, run the following:

   ```shell
   yarn test -t plays
   ```

   From now on, to test something, you only need to modify the contents of the tested [receiver function](/book/contracts#receiver-functions) of your Tact contract file and re-run the command above. Rinse and repeat that process until you've tested what you intended to test.

   For simplicity and cleaner output, you may add a new field to `scripts` in your `package.json`, enabling execution of `yarn lab{:shell}` to build and test in one step.

   On Linux or macOS, it would look like:

   ```json filename="package.json" {3}
   {
     "scripts": {
       "lab": "blueprint build --all 1>/dev/null && yarn test -t plays"
     }
   }
   ```

   And here's how it may look on Windows:

   ```json filename="package.json" {3-4}
   {
     "scripts": {
       "build": "blueprint build --all | out-null",
       "lab": "yarn build && yarn test -t plays"
     }
   }
   ```

   To run:

   ```shell
   yarn lab
   ```
