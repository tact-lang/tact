TON is a distributed blockchain which means that communication between contracts is done by sending and receiving messages. The most common type of messages is the internal message - a message sent from one contract (or a wallet) to another.

## Receive internal messages

To receive a message of the required type, you need to declare a receiver function, for example, `receive("increment"){:tact}`. This notation means the declaration of a receiver function that will be called when a text with the value `"increment"{:tact}` is sent to the contract. The function body can modify the state of the contract and send messages to other contracts. It is impossible to call a receiver directly. If you need to reuse some logic you can declare a function and call it from the receiver.

There are several receiver functions. All receiver functions are processed in the order they are listed below:

* `receive(){:tact}` - called when an empty message is sent to the contract
* `receive("message"){:tact}` - called when a text message with a specific comment is sent to the contract
* `receive(str: String){:tact}` - called when an arbitrary text message is sent to the contract
* `receive(msg: MyMessage){:tact}` - called when a binary message of type `MyMessage` is sent to the contract
* `receive(msg: Slice){:tact}` - called when binary message of unknown type is sent to the contract

```tact
message MyMessage {
    value: Int;
}

contract MyContract {
    receive() {
        // ...
    }
    receive("message") {
        // ...
    }
    receive(str: String) {
        // ...
    }
    receive(msg: MyMessage) {
        // ...
    }
    receive(msg: Slice) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Naming a parameter of the receiver function with an underscore `_{:tact}` makes its value considered unused and discarded. This is useful when you don't need to inspect the message received and you only want it to convey a specific opcode:

```tact
message(42) UniverseCalls {}

contract Example {
    receive(_: UniverseCalls) {
        // Got a Message with opcode 42
    }
}
```
