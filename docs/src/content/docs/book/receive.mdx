TON is a distributed blockchain, which means that communication between contracts is performed by sending and receiving messages. The most common type of message is the _internal message_ — a message sent from one contract (or a wallet) to another.

## Receive internal messages

To receive a message of the required type, you need to declare a receiver function. For example, `receive("increment"){:tact}`. This notation means the declaration of a receiver function that will be called when a text with the value `"increment"{:tact}` is sent to the contract. The function body can modify the state of the contract and send messages to other contracts. It is impossible to call a receiver directly. If you need to reuse some logic, you can declare a function and call it from the receiver.

### Empty receiver

This receiver specifically handles internal messages with no contents, i.e., the `null{:tact}` body. Note that as a function, it's own body doesn't have to be empty.

```tact
contract Emptiness() {
    // This receiver handles `null` (empty) message bodies of internal messages.
    receive() {
        // Although you can use this receiver for anything,
        // it's most common to utilize it for deployments and forward excess funds
        // from the incoming message back to the sender's address.
        cashback(sender());
    }
}
```

### Text receivers

<Badge text="500+ gas" title="Uses 500 gas units or more" variant="danger" size="medium"/><p/>

There are two kinds of text receivers:

* `receive("..."){:tact}` — the exact text receiver that handles specific string comments with the maximum length of 123 bytes
* `receive(str: String){:tact}` — the catch-all string receiver that handles arbitrary string comments

Processing and distinguishing text receivers, e.g., the comment receiver `receive("..."){:tact}` and the string receiver `receive(str: String){:tact}`, costs significantly more gas than [processing binary ones](#binary-receivers), such as `receive(){:tact}` or `receive(msg: MyMessage){:tact}`. Thus, it is recommended to [prefer binary receivers to text receivers](/book/gas-best-practices#prefer-binary-receivers-to-text-receivers).

```tact
contract CertainMD() {
    receive("time changes everything") {
        message(MessageParameters {
            to: sender(),
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue,
            body: "Doing things changes things. Not doing things leaves things exactly as they were".asComment(),
        });
    }

    receive(str: String) {
        message(MessageParameters {
            to: sender(),
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue,
            body: "Do I get bonus points if I act like I care?".asComment(),
        });
    }
}
```

### Binary receivers

If the message body starts with a recognized [opcode](/book/structs-and-messages#message-opcodes) of 4 non-zero bytes, that internal message will be handled with a corresponding binary receiver `receive(msg: MessageStruct){:tact}` or the catch-all slice receiver `receive(msg: Slice){:tact}`, if there is no binary receiver for that opcode.

```tact
// This message struct overrides its unique id (opcode) with 411,
// which allows message bodies that start with such opcodes
// to be recognized and handled by the respective binary receiver function.
message(411) HandleMe {}

contract Handler() {
    receive(msg: HandleMe) {
        let body = inMsg();
        body.preloadUint(32) == HandleMe.opcode(); // true
    }
}
```

## Processing order

All receiver functions are processed in the order they are listed below. The first receiver that matches the message type processes the message:

* `receive(){:tact}` - called when an empty message is sent to the contract
* `receive("message"){:tact}` - called when a text message with a specific comment is sent to the contract (maximum `"message"{:tact}` length is 123 bytes)
* `receive(str: String){:tact}` - called when an arbitrary text message is sent to the contract
* `receive(msg: MyMessage){:tact}` - called when a binary message of type `MyMessage` is sent to the contract
* `receive(msg: Slice){:tact}` - called when a binary message of unknown type is sent to the contract

For example, an empty message gets processed by `receive(){:tact}` and not by `receive(msg: Slice){:tact}`, because the former occurs before the latter in the above list. Similarly, a message with the specific comment `"message"{:tact}` gets processed by `receive("message"){:tact}` and not by `receive(str: String){:tact}`.

```tact
message MyMessage {
    value: Int;
}

contract MyContract {
    receive() {
        // ...
    }
    receive("message") {
        // ...
    }
    receive(str: String) {
        // ...
    }
    receive(msg: MyMessage) {
        // ...
    }
    receive(msg: Slice) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

In a contract, the order of declaration of receivers has no effect on how receivers process messages. Hence, changing the order of receivers in the above contract produces an equivalent contract.

Contracts are not required to declare receivers for all possible message types. If a contract does not have a receiver for a specific message type, the message will be processed by the next receiver that matches the message type in the receiver execution order list. For example, if we remove the receiver `receive("message"){:tact}` in the above contract, then when a message with the comment `"message"{:tact}` arrives, it will be processed by `receive(str: String){:tact}`. yet, the message with an empty comment `""{:tact}` will be processed by the empty body receiver, `receive(){:tact}`.

Note that the receiver `receive(msg: Slice){:tact}` acts as a fallback that catches all messages that did not match previous receivers in the execution order list. If there is no receiver to process a message type and the fallback receiver `receive(msg: Slice){:tact}` is not declared, the transaction will fail with exit code [130](/book/exit-codes/#130).

Receivers accept all incoming funds by default. That is, without explicitly sending a message that will refund spare Toncoin with the [`cashback(){:tact}`](/ref/core-send#cashback) function, the contract will keep all the incoming message value.

To check the amount of Toncoin (native coins) the incoming message carries with it, you can use the [`context(){:tact}`](/ref/core-contextstate#context) function and access the `value` field of its resulting [struct](/book/structs-and-messages#structs). Note, however, that the exact value by which the balance will be increased will be less than `context().value{:tact}` since the [compute fee](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees-low-level#computation-fees) for contract execution will be deducted from this value.

```tact /context\(\).value/
contract WalletV4(
    // ...contract variables...
) {
    // ...
    receive(msg: PluginRequestFunds) {
        require(
            myBalance() - context().value >= msg.amount,
            "The balance is too low to fulfill the plugin request!",
        );
        // ...
    }
}

message(0x706c7567) PluginRequestFunds {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as coins;
    extra: Cell?;
}
```

Naming the parameter of a receiver function with an underscore `_{:tact}` makes its value considered unused and discarded. This is useful when you don't need to inspect the message received and only want it to convey a specific opcode:

```tact
message(42) UniverseCalls {}

contract Example {
    receive(_: UniverseCalls) {
        // Got a Message with opcode 42
    }
}
```
