[//]: # (✅❌)

There are several anti-patterns and potential attack vectors that Tact smart contract developers should be aware of. These can affect the security, efficiency, and correctness of the contracts. Below we discuss the do's and don'ts specific to writing and maintaining secure Tact smart contracts.

For a deeper understanding, refer to the following resources:

* [Smart contracts guidelines in TON Docs](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/guidelines)
* [Secure Smart Contract Programming in TON Docs](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/security/secure-programming)
* [Curated list of awesome TON security resources](https://github.com/Polaristow/awesome-ton-security/blob/main/README.md)

In addition, consider reading the detailed article by CertiK, a Web3 smart contract auditor: [Secure Smart Contract Programming in Tact: Popular Mistakes in the TON Ecosystem](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/secure-smart-contract-programming-in-tact-popular-mistakes-in-the-ton).

## Sending sensitive data on-chain

The entire smart contract computation is transparent, and if you have confidential values at runtime, they can be retrieved through simple emulation.

##### Do's ✅

Do **not** send or store sensitive data on-chain.

##### Don'ts ❌

```tact
message Login {
    privateKey: Int as uint256;
    signature: Slice;
    data: Slice;
}

contract Test() {
    receive(msg: Login) {
        let publicKey = getPublicKey(msg.privateKey);

        require(checkDataSignature(msg.data, msg.signature, publicKey), "Invalid signature!");
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}
```

## Misuse of signed integers

Unsigned integers are safer because they prevent most errors by design, while signed integers can have unpredictable consequences if not used carefully. Therefore, signed integers should be used only when absolutely necessary.

##### Do's ✅

Prefer to use unsigned integers unless signed integers are required.

##### Don'ts ❌

The following is an example of the incorrect use of a signed integer. In the `Vote{:tact}` [Message][message], the type of the `votes` field is `Int as int32{:tact}`, which is a 32-bit signed integer. This can lead to spoofing if an attacker sends a negative number of votes instead of a positive one.

```tact
message Vote { votes: Int as int32 }

contract VoteCounter(
    votes: Int as uint32,
) {
    receive(msg: Vote) {
        self.votes += msg.votes;
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}
```

## Invalid throw values

[Exit codes](/book/exit-codes) 0 and 1 indicate normal execution of the compute phase of the transaction. Execution can be unexpectedly aborted by calling a [`throw(){:tact}`](/ref/core-debug#throw) or [similar functions](/ref/core-debug) directly with exit codes 0 and 1. This can make debugging very difficult since such aborted execution would be indistinguishable from a normal one.

##### Do's ✅

Prefer to use the [`require(){:tact}`](/ref/core-debug#require) function to state expectations.

```tact
require(isDataValid(msg.data), "Invalid data!");
```

##### Don'ts ❌

Don't throw 0 or 1 directly.

```tact
throw(0);
throw(1);
```

## Insecure random numbers

Generating truly secure random numbers in TON is challenging. The [`random()`](/ref/core-random#random) function is pseudo-random and depends on [logical time](https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/message-delivery-guarantees#what-is-a-logical-time). An attacker can predict the randomized number by [brute-forcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack) the logical time in the current block.

##### Do's ✅

* For critical applications, **avoid relying solely on on-chain solutions**.

* Use [`random(){:tact}`](/ref/core-random#random) with randomized logical time to enhance security by making predictions harder for attackers without access to a validator node. Note, however, that it is still **not entirely foolproof**.

* Consider using the **commit-and-disclose scheme**:
1. Participants generate random numbers off-chain and send their hashes to the contract.
2. Once all hashes are received, participants disclose their original numbers.
3. Combine the disclosed numbers (e.g., summing them) to produce a secure random value.

For more details, refer to the [Secure Random Number Generation page in TON Docs](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/security/random-number-generation).

##### Don'ts ❌

Don't rely on the [`random(){:tact}`](/ref/core-random#random) function.

```tact
if (random(1, 10) == 7) {
    // ...subsequent logic...
}
```

Don't use randomization in [`external(){:tact}`](/book/external) message receivers, as it remains vulnerable even with randomized logical time.

## Optimized message handling

String parsing from human-friendly formats into machine-readable binary structures should be done **off-chain**. This approach ensures that only optimized and compact messages are sent to the blockchain, minimizing computational and storage costs while avoiding unnecessary gas overhead.

##### Do's ✅

Perform string parsing from human-readable formats into machine-readable binary structures **off-chain** to keep the contract efficient.

```tact
message Sample { parsedField: Slice }

contract Example() {
    receive(msg: Sample) {
        // Process msg.parsedField directly
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}
```

##### Don'ts ❌

Avoid parsing strings from human-readable formats into binary structures **on-chain**, as this increases computational overhead and gas costs.

```tact
message Sample { field: String }

contract Example {
    receive(msg: Sample) {
        // Parsing occurs on-chain, which is inefficient
        let parsed = field.fromBase64();
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}
```

## Gas limitation

Be careful with the `Out of gas error`. It cannot be handled, so try to pre-calculate the gas consumption for each receiver [using tests](/book/debug#tests) whenever possible. This will help avoid wasting extra gas, as the transaction will fail anyway.

##### Do's ✅

```tact
message Vote { votes: Int as int32 }

contract VoteCounter() {
    const voteGasUsage = 10000; // precompute with tests

    receive(msg: Vote) {
        require(context().value > getComputeFee(self.voteGasUsage, false), "Not enough gas!");
        // ...subsequent logic...
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}
```

## Identity validation

Always validate the identity of the sender if your contract logic revolves around trusted senders. This can be done using the [`Ownable{:tact}`](/ref/stdlib-ownable) trait or using [state init](/book/expressions#initof) validation. You can read more about [Jetton validation](/cookbook/jettons#accepting-jetton-transfer) and [NFT validation](/cookbook/nfts#accepting-nft-ownership-assignment).

##### Do's ✅

Use the [`Ownable{:tact}`](/ref/stdlib-ownable) trait.

```tact
import "@stdlib/ownable";

message Inc { amount: Int as uint32 }

contract Counter with Ownable {
    owner: Address;
    val: Int as uint32;

    init() {
        self.owner = address("...SOME ADDRESS...");
        self.val = 0;
    }

    receive(msg: Inc) {
        self.requireOwner();
        self.val += msg.amount;
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}
```

##### Don'ts ❌

Do not execute a message without validating the sender's identity!

```tact
contract Jetton {
    myJettonWalletAddress: Address;
    myJettonAmount: Int as coins = 0;

    init(jettonWalletCode: Cell, jettonMasterAddress: Address) {
        self.myJettonWalletAddress = calculateJettonWalletAddress(
            myAddress(),
            jettonMasterAddress,
            jettonWalletCode,
        );
    }

    receive(msg: JettonTransferNotification) {
        // There's no check of the ownership here!
        self.myJettonAmount += msg.amount;
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}
```

## Replay protection

Replay protection is a security mechanism that prevents an attacker from reusing a previous message. More information about replay protection can be found on the [External messages page in TON Docs](https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/external-messages).

##### Do's ✅

To differentiate messages, always include and validate a unique identifier, such as `seqno`. Update the identifier after successful processing to avoid duplicates.

Alternatively, you can implement replay protection similar to the one in the [highload v3 wallet](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/highload-wallet-contract-v3/blob/main/contracts/highload-wallet-v3.func#L60), which is not based on `seqno`.

```tact
message MsgWithSignedData {
    bundle: SignedBundle;
    seqno: Int as uint64;
    rawMsg: Cell;
}

contract Sample(
    publicKey: Int as uint256,
    seqno: Int as uint64,
) {
    external(msg: MsgWithSignedData) {
        require(msg.bundle.verifySignature(self.publicKey), "Invalid signature");
        acceptMessage();
        self.seqno += 1;
        sendRawMessage(msg.rawMsg, 0);
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}
```

##### Don'ts ❌

Do not rely on signature verification without the inclusion of a sequence number. Messages without replay protection can be resent by attackers because there is nothing to distinguish a valid original message from a replayed one.

```tact
message Msg {
    newMessage: Cell;
    signature: Slice;
}

contract Sample(
    publicKey: Int as uint256,
) {
    external(msg: Msg) {
        require(
            checkDataSignature(msg.toSlice(), msg.signature, self.publicKey),
            "Invalid signature",
        );
        acceptMessage();
        sendRawMessage(msg.newMessage, 0);
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}
```

## Preventing front-running with signature verification

In TON blockchain, all pending messages are publicly visible in the mempool.
Front-running can occur when an attacker observes a pending transaction containing a valid signature and quickly submits their own transaction using the same signature before the original transaction is processed.

##### Do's ✅

Include critical parameters like the recipient address (`to`) within the data that is signed. This ensures that the signature is valid only for the intended operation and recipient, preventing attackers from reusing the signature for their benefit. Also, implement replay protection to prevent the same signed message from being used multiple times.

```tact
struct RequestBody {
    to: Address;
    seqno: Int as uint64;
}

message(0x988d4037) Request {
    signature: Slice as bytes64;
    requestBody: RequestBody;
}

contract SecureChecker(
    publicKey: Int as uint256,
    seqno: Int as uint64, // Add seqno for replay protection
) {
    receive(request: Request) {
        // Verify the signature against the reconstructed data hash
        require(checkSignature(request.requestBody.toCell().hash(), request.signature, self.publicKey), "Invalid signature!");

        // Check replay protection
        require(request.requestBody.seqno == self.seqno, "Invalid seqno"); // Assuming external message with seqno
        self.seqno += 1; // Increment seqno after successful processing

        // Ensure the message is sent to the address specified in the signed data
        message(MessageParameters {
            to: request.requestBody.to, // Use the 'to' from the signed request
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingBalance, // Caution: sending the whole balance!
            bounce: false,
            body: "Your action payload here".asComment(), // Example body
        });
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }

    get fun seqno(): Int {
        return self.seqno;
    }
}

```

Remember to also implement [replay protection](#replay-protection) to prevent reusing the same signature even if it's correctly targeted.

##### Don'ts ❌

Do not sign data without including essential context like the recipient address. An attacker could intercept the message, copy the signature, and replace the recipient address in their own transaction, effectively redirecting the intended action or funds.

```tact
message(0x988d4037) Request {
    signature: Slice as bytes64;
    data: Slice as remaining; // 'to' address is not part of the signed data
}

contract InsecureChecker(
    publicKey: Int as uint256,
) {
    receive(request: Request) {
        // The signature only verifies 'request.data', not the intended recipient.
        if (checkDataSignature(request.data.hash(), request.signature, self.publicKey)) {
            // Attacker can see this message, copy the signature, and send their own
            // message to a different 'to' address before this one confirms.
            // The 'sender()' here is the original sender, but the attacker can initiate
            // a similar transaction targeting themselves or another address.
            message(MessageParameters {
                to: sender(), // Vulnerable: recipient isn't verified by the signature
                value: 0,
                mode: SendRemainingBalance, // Caution: sending the whole balance!
                bounce: false,
            });
        }
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}
```
:::caution[Sandbox Limitations]
This specific front-running scenario is not reproducible in the `@ton/sandbox` environment due to differences in transaction processing and the absence of a mempool compared to the real network. Always be mindful that local testing environments like the sandbox may not fully capture all real-world network conditions and potential attack vectors.
:::

Furthermore, once a signature is used in a transaction, it becomes publicly visible on the blockchain. Without proper replay protection, anyone can potentially reuse this signature and the associated data in a new transaction if the contract logic doesn't prevent it.

## Race condition of messages

A message cascade can be processed over many blocks. Assume that while one message flow is running, an attacker can initiate a second message flow in parallel. That is, if a property was checked at the beginning, such as whether the user has enough tokens, do not assume that it will still be satisfied at the third stage in the same contract.

## Handle/Send bounced messages

Send messages with the bounce flag set to `true{:tact}`, which is the default for the [`send(){:tact}`](/ref/core-send#send), [`message(){:tact}`](/ref/core-send#message), and [`deploy(){:tact}`](/ref/core-send#deploy) functions. Messages bounce when the execution of a contract fails. You may want to handle this by rolling back the state of the contract using [`try...catch{:tact}`](/book/statements#try-catch) statements and performing additional processing depending on your logic.

##### Do's ✅

Handle bounced messages via a [bounced message receiver](/book/bounced/#bounced-message-receiver) to correctly react to failed messages.

```tact
contract JettonWalletSample(
    owner: Address,
    master: Address,
    balance: Int,
) {
    const minTonsForStorage: Int = ton("0.01");
    const gasConsumption: Int = ton("0.01");

    receive(msg: TokenBurn) {
        let ctx: Context = context();
        require(ctx.sender == self.owner, "Invalid sender");

        self.balance = self.balance - msg.amount;
        require(self.balance >= 0, "Invalid balance");

        let fwdFee: Int = ctx.readForwardFee();
        require(
            ctx.value >
            fwdFee + 2 * self.gasConsumption + self.minTonsForStorage,
            "Invalid value - Burn",
        );

        message(MessageParameters {
            to: self.master,
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue,
            bounce: true,
            body: TokenBurnNotification {
                queryId: msg.queryId,
                amount: msg.amount,
                owner: self.owner,
                response_destination: self.owner,
            }.toCell(),
        });
    }

    bounced(src: bounced<TokenBurnNotification>) {
        self.balance = self.balance + src.amount;
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}
```

## Transaction and phases

From the [Sending messages page](/book/send#outbound-message-processing) of the Book:

> Each transaction on TON Blockchain consists of multiple phases. Outbound messages are evaluated in the compute phase but are **not** sent in that phase. Instead, they're queued in order of appearance for the action phase, where all actions listed in the compute phase, such as outbound messages or reserve requests, are executed.

Hence, if the compute phase fails, [registers](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#control-registers) `c4` (persistent data) and `c5` (actions) won't be updated. However, it is possible to manually save their state using the [`commit(){:tact}`](/ref/core-contextstate#commit) function.

## Return gas excesses carefully

If excess gas is not returned to the sender, the funds will accumulate in your contracts over time. This isn't terrible in principle, just a suboptimal practice. You can add a function to rake out excess, but popular contracts like TON Jetton still return it to the sender with the [Message][message] using the `0xd53276db` opcode.

##### Do's ✅

Return excesses using a [Message][message] with the `0xd53276db` opcode.

```tact
message(0xd53276db) Excesses {}
message Vote { votes: Int as int32 }

contract Sample(
    votes: Int as uint32,
) {
    receive(msg: Vote) {
        self.votes += msg.votes;

        message(MessageParameters {
            to: sender(),
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors,
            body: Excesses {}.toCell(),
        });
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}
```

## Pulling data from another contract

Contracts in the blockchain can reside in separate shards processed by another set of validators. This means that one contract cannot pull data from another contract. Specifically, no contract can call a [getter function](/book/functions#getter-functions) from another contract.

Thus, any on-chain communication is asynchronous and done by sending and receiving messages.

##### Do's ✅

Exchange messages to pull data from another contract.

```tact
message GetMoney {}
message ProvideMoney {}
message TakeMoney { money: Int as coins }

contract OneContract(
    money: Int as coins,
) {
    receive(msg: ProvideMoney) {
        message(MessageParameters {
            to: sender(),
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors,
            body: TakeMoney { money: self.money }.toCell(),
        });
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}

contract AnotherContract(
    oneContractAddress: Address,
) {
    receive(_: GetMoney) {
        message(MessageParameters {
            to: self.oneContractAddress,
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors,
            bounce: false,
            body: ProvideMoney {}.toCell(),
        });
    }

    receive(msg: TakeMoney) {
        require(sender() == self.oneContractAddress, "Invalid money provider!");
        // ...further processing...
    }

    // Empty receiver for the deployment,
    // which forwards the remaining value back to the sender
    receive() { cashback(sender()) }
}
```
