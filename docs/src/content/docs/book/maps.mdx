description: "The composite type map is used as a way to associate keys with corresponding values of various types"
---

import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The [composite type](/book/types#composite-types) `map<K, V>{:tact}` is used as a way to associate keys of type `K{:tact}` with corresponding values of type `V{:tact}`.

For example, `map<Int, Int>{:tact}` uses [`Int{:tact}`][int] type for its keys and values:

```tact
struct IntToInt {
    counters: map<Int, Int>;
}
```

## Allowed types

Allowed key types:

* [`Int{:tact}`][int]
* [`Address{:tact}`][p]

Allowed value types:

* [`Int{:tact}`][int]
* [`Bool{:tact}`](/book/types#booleans)
* [`Cell{:tact}`][cell]
* [`Address{:tact}`][p]
* [Struct](/book/structs-and-messages#structs)
* [Message](/book/structs-and-messages#messages)

## Operations

### Declare, `emptyMap()` {#emptymap}

As a [local variable](/book/statements#let), using `emptyMap(){:tact}` function of standard library:

```tact
let fizz: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();
let fizz: map<Int, Int> = null; // identical to the previous line, but less descriptive
```

As a [persistent state variable](/book/contracts#variables):

```tact
contract Example {
    fizz: map<Int, Int>; // Int keys to Int values
    init() {
        self.fizz = emptyMap(); // redundant and can be removed!
    }
}
```

Note, that [persistent state variables](/book/contracts#variables) of type `map<K, V>{:tact}` are initialized empty by default and don't need default values or an initialization in the [`init(){:tact}` function](/book/contracts#init-function).

### Set values, `.set()` {#set}

To set or replace the value under a key call the `.set(){:tact}` [method](/book/functions#extension-function), which is accessible for all maps.

```tact
// Empty map
let fizz: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();

// Setting a couple of values under different keys
fizz.set(7, 7);
fizz.set(42, 42);

// Overriding one of the existing key-value pairs
fizz.set(7, 68); // key 7 now points to value 68
```

### Get values, `.get()` {#get}

To check if a key is found in the map by calling the `.get(){:tact}` [method](/book/functions#extension-function), which is accessible for all maps. This will return `null{:tact}` if the key is missing, or the value if the key is found.

```tact
// Empty map
let fizz: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();

// Setting a value
fizz.set(68, 0);

// Getting the value by its key
let gotButUnsure: Int? = fizz.get(68);          // returns Int or null, therefore the type is Int?
let mustHaveGotOrErrored: Int = fizz.get(68)!!; // explicitly asserting that the value must not be null,
                                                // which may crush at runtime if the value is, in fact, null

// Alternatively, we can check for the key in the if statement
if (gotButUnsure != null) {
    // Hooray, let's use !! without fear now and cast Int? to Int
    let definitelyGotIt: Int = fizz.get(68)!!;
} else {
    // Do something else...
}
```

### Delete entries, `.del()` {#del}

To delete a single key-value pair (single entry), use the `.del(){:tact}` [method](/book/functions#extension-function). It returns `true{:tact}` in the case of successful deletion and `false{:tact}` otherwise.

```tact
// Empty map
let fizz: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();

// Setting a couple of values under different keys
fizz.set(7, 123);
fizz.set(42, 321);

// Deleting one of the keys
let deletionSuccess: Bool = fizz.del(7); // true, because map contained the entry under key 7
fizz.del(7);                             // false, because map no longer has an entry under key 7

// Note, that assigning the `null` value to the key when using the `.set()` method
//   is equivalent to calling `.del()`, although such approach is much less descriptive
//   and is generally discouraged:
fizz.set(42, null); // the entry under key 42 is now deleted
```

To delete all the entries from the map, re-assign the map using the `emptyMap(){:tact}` function:

```tact
// Empty map
let fizz: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();

// Setting a couple of values under different keys
fizz.set(7, 123);
fizz.set(42, 321);

// Deleting all of the entries at once
fizz = emptyMap();
fizz = null; // identical to the previous line, but less descriptive
```

With this approach all previous entries of the map are completely discarded from the contract even if the map was declared as its persistent state variable. As a result, assigning maps to `emptyMap(){:tact}` **does not** inflict any hidden or sudden [storage fees](https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/fees#storage-fee).

### Check if entry exists, `.exists()` {#exists}

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.5" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

The `.exists(){:tact}` [method](/book/functions#extension-function) on maps returns `true{:tact}` if the value under the given key exists in the map and `false{:tact}` otherwise.

```tact
let fizz: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();
fizz.set(0, 0);

if (fizz.exists(2 + 2)) { // false
    dump("Something doesn't add up!");
}

if (fizz.exists(1 / 2)) { // true
    dump("I told a fraction joke once. It was half funny.");
}

if (fizz.get(1 / 2) != null) { // also true, but consumes more gas
    dump("Gotta pump more!");
}
```

:::note

  Calling `m.exists(key){:tact}` is more gas-efficient than executing `m.get(key) != null{:tact}`, although both approaches yield the same results.

:::

### Check if empty, `.isEmpty()` {#isempty}

The `.isEmpty(){:tact}` [method](/book/functions#extension-function) on maps returns `true{:tact}` if the map is empty and `false{:tact}` otherwise:

```tact
let fizz: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();

if (fizz.isEmpty()) {
    dump("Empty maps are empty, duh!");
}

// Note, that comparing the map to `null` behaves the same as `.isEmpty()` method,
// although such direct comparison is much less descriptive and is generally discouraged:
if (fizz == null) {
    dump("Empty maps are null, which isn't obvious");
}
```

### Compare with `.deepEquals()` {#deepequals}

<Badge text="Available since Tact 1.5" variant="tip" size="medium"/><p/>

The `.deepEquals(){:tact}` [method](/book/functions#extension-function) on maps returns `true{:tact}` if all entries of the map match corresponding entries of another map, ignoring possible differences in the [underlying serialization logic][hashmap]. Returns `false{:tact}` otherwise.

```tact
let fizz: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();
let buzz: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();

fizz.set(1, 2);
buzz.set(1, 2);

fizz.deepEquals(buzz); // true
fizz == buzz;          // true, and uses much less gas to compute
```

Using `.deepEquals(){:tact}` is very important in cases where a map comes from the third-party source that doesn't provide any guarantees about the [serialization layout][hashmap]. For one such example, consider the following code:

```typescript title="some-typescript-code.ts"
// First map, with long labels
const m1 = beginCell()
    .storeUint(2, 2) // long label
    .storeUint(8, 4) // key length
    .storeUint(1, 8) // key
    .storeBit(true)  // value
    .endCell();

// Second map, with short labels
const m2 = beginCell()
    .storeUint(0, 1)           // short label
    .storeUint(0b111111110, 9) // key length
    .storeUint(1, 8)           // key
    .storeBit(true)            // value
    .endCell();
```

There, both maps are formed manually and both contain the same key-value pair. If you were to send both of those maps in a message to the Tact contract, and then compare them with `.deepEquals(){:tact}` and [equality operator `=={:tact}`](/book/operators#binary-equality), the former would produce `true{:tact}` because both maps have the same entry, while the latter would produce `false{:tact}`, because it only does the shallow comparison of map hashes. And those differ since the maps are serialized differently.

:::note

  This function is very gas expensive, and for the majority of cases it'll be enough to use the shallow comparison via the [equality `=={:tact}`](/book/operators#binary-equality) or [inequality `!={:tact}`](/book/operators#binary-equality) operators.

:::

### Convert to a `Cell`, `.asCell()` {#ascell}

Use `.asCell(){:tact}` [method](/book/functions#extension-function) on maps to convert all their values to a [`Cell{:tact}`][cell] type. Be mindful, that [`Cell{:tact}`][cell] type is able to store up to 1023 bits, so converting larger maps to the Cell will result in error.

As an example, this method is useful for sending small maps directly in the body of the reply:

```tact
contract Example {
    // Persistent state variables
    fizz: map<Int, Int>; // our map

    // Constructor (initialization) function of the contract
    init() {
        // Setting a bunch of values
        self.fizz.set(0, 3);
        self.fizz.set(1, 14);
        self.fizz.set(2, 15);
        self.fizz.set(3, 926);
        self.fizz.set(4, 5_358_979_323_846);
    }

    // Internal message receiver, which responds to empty messages
    receive() {
        // Here we're converting the map to a Cell and making a reply with it
        self.reply(self.fizz.asCell());
    }
}
```

### Traverse over entries {#traverse}

To iterate over map entries there is a [`foreach{:tact}`](/book/statements#foreach-loop) loop statement:

```tact
// Empty map
let fizz: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();

// Setting a couple of values under different keys
fizz.set(42, 321);
fizz.set(7, 123);

// Iterating over in a sequential order: from the smallest keys to the biggest ones
foreach (key, value in fizz) {
    dump(key); // will dump 7 on the first iteration, then 42 on the second
}
```

Read more about it: [`foreach{:tact}` loop in Bookâ†’Statements](/book/statements#foreach-loop).

Note, that it's also possible to use maps as simple arrays if you define a `map<Int, V>{:tact}` with an [`Int{:tact}`][int] type for the keys, any allowed `V{:tact}` type for values and keep track of the number of items in the separate variable:

```tact
contract Iteration {
    // Persistent state variables
    counter: Int as uint32;    // counter of map entries, serialized as a 32-bit unsigned
    record: map<Int, Address>; // Int to Address map

    // Constructor (initialization) function of the contract
    init() {
        self.counter = 0; // Setting the self.counter to 0
    }

    // Internal message receiver, which responds to a String message "Add"
    receive("Add") {
        // Get the Context Struct
        let ctx: Context = context();
        // Set the entry: counter Int as a key, ctx.sender Address as a value
        self.record.set(self.counter, ctx.sender);
        // Increase the counter
        self.counter += 1;
    }

    // Internal message receiver, which responds to a String message "Send"
    receive("Send") {
        // Loop until the value of self.counter (over all the self.record entries)
        let i: Int = 0; // declare usual i for loop iterations
        while (i < self.counter) {
           send(SendParameters{
                bounce: false,              // do not bounce back this message
                to: self.record.get(i)!!,   // set the sender address, knowing that key i exists in the map
                value: ton("0.0000001"),    // 100 nanoToncoins (nano-tons)
                mode: SendIgnoreErrors,     // send ignoring errors in transaction, if any
                body: "SENDING".asComment() // String "SENDING" converted to a Cell as a message body
            });
            i += 1; // don't forget to increase the i
        }
    }

    // Getter function for obtaining the value of self.record
    get fun map(): map<Int, Address> {
        return self.record;
    }

    // Getter function for obtaining the value of self.counter
    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }
}
```

It's often useful to set an upper-bound restriction on such maps, so that you [don't hit the limits](#limits-and-drawbacks).

:::caution

  Note, that manually keeping track of number of items or checking the length of such map is very error-prone and generally discouraged. Instead, try to wrap your map into the [Struct](/book/structs-and-messages#structs) and define [extension functions](/book/functions#extension-function) on it. See example in the Cookbook: [How to emulate an array using a map wrapped in a Struct](/cookbook/data-structures#array).

## Serialization

It's possible to do [integer serialization](/book/integers#common-serialization-types) of map keys, values or both to [preserve space and reduce storage costs](/book/integers#serialization):

```tact
struct SerializedMapInside {
    // Both keys and values here would be serialized as 8-bit unsigned integers,
    // thus preserving the space and reducing storage costs:
    countersButCompact: map<Int as uint8, Int as uint8>;
}
```

## Limits and drawbacks

While maps can be convenient to work with on a small scale, they cause a number of issues if the number of items is unbounded and map can significantly grow in size:

* As the upper bound of the smart contract state size is around $65\,000$ items of type [`Cell{:tact}`][cell], it constrains the storage limit of maps to be about $30\,000$ key-value pairs for the whole contract.

* The more entries you have in a map, the bigger [compute fees](https://docs.ton.org/develop/howto/fees-low-level#computation-fees) you'll get. Thus, working with large maps makes compute fees tough to predict and manage.

* Using a large map in a single contract doesn't allow to distribute its workload. Hence, it can make the overall performance much worse compared to  using a smaller map and a bunch of interacting smart contracts.

To resolve such issues you can set an upper-bound restriction on a map as a constant and check against it every time you're setting a new value to the map:

```tact
contract Example {
    // Declare a compile-time constant upper-bound for our map
    const MaxMapSize: Int = 42;

    // Persistent state variables
    arr: map<Int, Int>; // "array" of Int values as a map
    arrLength: Int = 0; // length of the "array", defaults to 0

    // Internal function for pushing an item to the end of the "array"
    fun arrPush(item: Int) {
        if (self.arrLength >= self.MaxMapSize) {
            // Do something, stop the operation, for example
        } else {
            // Proceed with adding new item
            self.arr.set(self.arrLength, item);
            self.arrLength += 1;
        }
    }
}
```

If you still need a large map or an unbound (infinitely large) map, it's better to architect your smart contracts according to the [asynchronous and actor-based model of TON blockchain](https://docs.ton.org/learn/overviews/ton-blockchain). That is, to use contract sharding and essentially make the whole blockchain a part of your map(s).
