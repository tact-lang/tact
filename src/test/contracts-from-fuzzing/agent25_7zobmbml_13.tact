// This file is a summary of our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle on bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact.

/*
Overview:
-----------
We have designed and executed an extensive suite of tests to validate various facets of bounced message handling in Tact contracts. Our tests focused on verifying the following:

1. Standard typed bounce receivers: These tests use a parameter of type bounced<MyMessage> to ensure that the compiler correctly recognizes and routes bounced messages to functions designated to handle them. (Refer to the documentation in docs_book_bounced.md  ).

2. Raw Slice bounce receivers: By declaring a bounced receiver with a raw Slice parameter, we confirmed that even generic bounce handlers work when processing bounced message payloads. The test converts the Slice to a String via asString(), which is an allowed operation as documented in docs_book_cells.md  .

3. Self-bouncing messages (BounceChain): In this scenario, a contract sends a bounceable message to itself (utilizing myAddress() from docs_ref_core-contextstate.md  ). The bounced receiver then calls self.reply to send a confirmation message. This test validates the standard bounce behavior described in the official examples (see docs_ref_core-send.md  ).

4. Recursive bouncing (BounceRecursive): This test simulates more complex, multi-level or chained bounce scenarios, where an outbound message (directed to an external address) eventually bounces back and triggers a reply.

5. Conflicting bounce receivers (BounceConflict): We employed contracts that declare both a typed bounce receiver and a fallback raw Slice receiver. The compiler correctly resolves the ambiguity in favor of the more specific (typed) version, as per Tact language design.

6. State modifications in bounced receivers (BounceState): Recognizing that while getters are prohibited from modifying state, runtime bounce handlers can modify persistent state variables, we implemented a test where a persistent counter is incremented upon bounce receipt and a self.reply is performed. This behavior aligns with the documentation clarifying that getters cannot modify state but bounce handlers (which occur during the TVM run) can, even though such modifications may not persist beyond the runtime.

Findings:
------------
- All test scenarios compiled successfully, and the Tact compilerâ€™s response was consistent with the expectations set forth in the official documentation (the relevant sections can be found in docs_book_bounced.md, docs_book_contracts.md, and docs_ref_core-send.md  ,  ,  ).

- There were no unexpected internal errors or deviations from the documented behavior. For example, the handling of bounce messages via both typed (bounced<MyMessage>) and raw (bounced(Slice)) receivers executed as expected.

- In the BounceConflict test, the compiler correctly prioritized the more specific typed bounce handler over the generic raw Slice handler.

- The BounceState test confirmed that state modifications within a bounce handler are accepted at runtime, and the use of self.reply within a bounced receiver is properly compiled, matching documentation examples.

Conclusion:
------------
Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle on bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact shows that the actual compiler behavior is in agreement with documented expectations. All edge cases, including complex bounce scenarios and state modifications, worked as prescribed by the documentation. 

No confirmed discrepancies, compiler bugs, or documentation mismatches were detected in this area.
