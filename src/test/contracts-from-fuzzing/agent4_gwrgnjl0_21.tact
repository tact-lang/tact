/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
In this fuzz-testing cycle, we performed an extensive evaluation of Tact maps (dictionaries) focusing on key/value types, serialization behavior, operations, nested maps, iteration constraints, and equality comparisons. Our strategy was to systematically validate each aspect mentioned in the official Tact documentation, including claims about allowed key and value types, operations like insertion (.set), querying (.get, .exists), updating (.replace, .replaceGet), deletion (.del), and differentiation between shallow (==) and deep (.deepEquals) equality.

Key Findings:
---------------
1. Allowed Key Types:
   - Official documentation (see  ) restricts keys to only Int and Address. 
   - Our tests (e.g., TestMapValid and TestAddressKey) confirmed that maps using Int and Address as keys compile and execute normally.
   - Any attempt to use disallowed key types such as String or user-defined Structs (see TestInvalidKey and TestStructKey) results in a compile-time error, which matches the documentation (see  ).

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   - Maps can hold values of types such as Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types, and support serialization for Int keys/values as documented (see  ). 
   - The TestSerializedMap snippet verified that specifying serialization formats (e.g., Int as uint8) for keys and values works as advertised.

3. Map Operations:
   - Our tests confirmed that fundamental map operations like .set(), .get(), .exists(), .replace(), .replaceGet(), and .del() behave precisely as documented in the official guide (see   and  ).
   - For instance, replacing a value in the map returns the appropriate boolean or old value, and deletion via setting a key to null (or .del()) correctly removes the mapping.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration:
   - Nested maps work correctly when properly referenced via state variable paths (e.g., self.data), which is verified by our nested maps tests (TestNestedMapsIteration).
   - The compiler restricts foreach iteration to valid path expressions, preventing iteration over maps returned from function calls, consistent with documented constraints (see  ).

5. Equality Comparisons:
   - Our tests differentiated between shallow equality using the '==' operator (which compares map cell hashes) and deep equality using the .deepEquals() method (which compares entries data-by-data). The behavior observed was in line with the documentation (see  ).

6. Boolean Map Values:
   - A map with Bool as the value type (TestMapBoolFixed) compiled after syntax adjustments and performed as expected, confirming that Bool is a valid value type.

Conclusion:
-----------
All our tests confirm that the Tact compiler enforces the documented constraints on maps. Key and value types are correctly validated; all map operations work as specified, nested maps can be used and iterated (under the documented constraints), and equality comparisons hold to the shallow vs deep behavior described in the docs. 

No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were found between the actual behavior of the compiler and the official Tact documentation regarding maps.
