/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
This fuzz-testing cycle focused on systematically validating every aspect of maps in Tact, including key/value type restrictions, serialization behavior, core operations (insertion, querying, replacement, deletion), nested map constructs and iteration limitations, and equality comparisons.

Key Findings:
-------------
1. Allowed Key Types:
   - Only Int and Address are allowed as keys, as documented in the official Tact docs. Our tests demonstrated that maps declared with key types such as map<Int, Int> and map<Address, Int> compile and function correctly. Attempts to use invalid key types (e.g. String or user-defined structs) are properly rejected by the compiler, generating clear error messages.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   - Maps support value types including Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types. Furthermore, only Int keys (and optionally Int values) allow for serialization (e.g. using "as uint8"). Test cases such as our TestSerializedMap confirmed that specifying serialization results in correct behavior and reduced storage requirements, in line with documentation.

3. Core Map Operations:
   - Insertion (.set), querying (.get, .exists), updating (.replace, .replaceGet), and deletion (.del or null assignments) all perform strictly as documented. Our tests demonstrated that operations return the expected boolean flags or previous values, and update the map's state as specified.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration Constraints:
   - Nested maps (e.g. encapsulating an inner map in a struct, such as AllowanceMap, and storing it in an outer map) function correctly when referenced via valid path expressions (e.g. self.data). Iteration with foreach works only on such valid references; attempts to iterate over maps returned by function calls are correctly rejected, confirming proper enforcement of language constraints.

5. Equality Comparisons:
   - The differentiation between shallow equality (using the '==' operator, which compares underlying map cell hashes) and deep equality (the .deepEquals() function, which performs entry-by-entry comparison) was accurately observed. Our experiments validate that even minor modifications in map entries are captured correctly by deep equality, as expected.

6. Edge Cases – Boolean Values:
   - Maps using Bool as values compile and operate correctly in conditional constructs after minor syntactical adjustments. This confirms that Bool is a valid and supported map value type.

Conclusion:
-----------
All test scenarios—covering valid and invalid key/value configurations, serialization, standard operations, nested map handling, iteration restrictions, and equality distinctions—validate that the Tact compiler’s implementation of maps conforms precisely to the documented specifications. No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were encountered.

Final Verdict: The maps feature in Tact is robust, fully compliant with its official documentation, and all fuzz tests returned the expected results.

Return Value: 0 (indicating that all map-related tests passed successfully).
