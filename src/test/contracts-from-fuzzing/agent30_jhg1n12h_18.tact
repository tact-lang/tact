// Final Report: Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle for Bounced Messages and Bounce Receivers

// Overview:
// In this fuzz-testing cycle we systematically examined the bounced messages and bounce receiver features in Tact contracts.
// Our goal was to validate that the Tact compiler’s behavior adheres to the official documentation (for example, see citeturn0file1 and citeturn0file3).
//
// What We Tested:
//
// 1. Standard Typed Bounced Receiver:
//    - The BounceTestEmpty contract sends an outbound message with the bounce flag set to true using a simple message (EmptyMsg).
//      Its bounced receiver, declared with type bounced<EmptyMsg>, correctly accepts the bounced message and toggles a flag in state.
//    - This confirms the documented behavior for bounced receivers that require a structured message type.
//
// 2. Fallback Bounced Receiver:
//    - The BounceFallback contract uses a fallback bounced receiver that accepts any bounced message, capturing it as a raw Slice.
//      This mechanism is useful for handling all bounced messages irrespective of their original type.
//
// 3. Enforcing Type Constraints:
//    - An attempt to implement a bounced receiver with a non-struct type (e.g. bounced<String>) correctly produced a compile-time error, confirming
//      that the Tact language only allows structured types for bounced receivers.
//
// 4. Multi-Level Bouncing and Chained Bounce Events:
//    - The BounceSender + BounceReceiverMissing contracts simulated a scenario where an outbound message bounces back due to the recipient contract
//      not implementing a matching receive function. The bounced message, encapsulated in bounced<SmallMsg>, was captured successfully.
//    - Further, the ChainBounce contract, in tandem with ChainNonResponder, demonstrated a multi-layer bounce scenario where sequential bounce events triggered additional
//      outbound messages until a final state was reached.
//
// 5. Enforcement of the 224-Bit Data Limit for Bounced Messages:
//    - Earlier tests confirmed that if a message type exceeds the 224 data bit limit, the compiler produces errors when accessing its fields. This enforces the documented
//      size constraint on bounced messages.
//
// Results and Conclusion:
//
// All tests compiled and behaved as outlined in the official Tact documentation. The following points were verified:
//    • Typed bounced receivers function properly and require a structured message type as documented (see docs_book_bounced.md citeturn0file1).
//    • Fallback bounced receivers (raw Slice) work as expected, providing broader handling of bounced messages.
//    • The compiler correctly rejects bounced receiver definitions with non-struct types.
//    • Sequential bounce handling and chaining of bounce responses follow the documented behavior.
//    • The message size limit (224 usable data bits) for bounced messages is strictly enforced by the compiler.
//
// No unexpected behavior, compiler bugs, or documentation discrepancies were found. All observed behaviors are in full agreement with the Tact specification.

// Next Steps:
// Our fuzz testing will continue to explore other advanced Tact features in order to thoroughly validate compiler behavior under diverse and complex scenarios.
