// Final summary snippet with comments

// Based on our extensive testing cycle for asm functions, we have verified the following:
//
// 1. Basic asm function behavior: simple TVM instructions like PUSHINT, ADD, SWAP, DUP worked as documented (see docs_book_assembly-functions.md   and  ).
//
// 2. Arrangements for both arguments and return types (as in swap_pair) work correctly, respecting the expected flattening order for structures, matching the documentation's explanations (see  ).
//
// 3. Error conditions are correctly enforced: omitting a consuming TVM instruction after a primitive and directly referencing a parameter result in expected compilation errors. This matches the documented requirement that primitives must be immediately followed by a consuming instruction, and that parameter identifiers are not directly accessible in the asm body (see  ).
//
// 4. Nested structure flattening (tested via sum_nested) confirms that nested structs are correctly flattened so that fields are placed in the intended order on the stack (as explained in   and others).
//
// 5. Attributes such as inline work as expected (asm functions are always inlined), and our misuse of the mutates attribute without extends produced the documented error, ensuring that restriction is enforced by the compiler.
//
// 6. Additional TVM instructions, including DROP, DEPTH, DUP, and ADD, behave as expected in the assembly context.
//
// Throughout our testing cycle, all snippets (except for the purposefully erroneous ones) compiled and behaved in accordance with the official documentation. We made extensive use of file_search to verify documentation details (see citations like  ,  ,  , etc.) and compiled numerous representative test cases.
//
// Conclusion: The Tact compilerâ€™s implementation of asm functions aligns with the documented specifications, and no discrepancies or novel bugs were detected in our exhaustive test suite for asm functions.

fun main() {
    // This main function is a placeholder, as all asm functions have been tested individually.
