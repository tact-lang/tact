/* Final Answer: Comprehensive Testing of asm Functions

/*
Our comprehensive testing cycle focused on the asm functions feature in Tact. We consulted the official Tact documentation on asm functions (e.g., docs_book_assembly-functions.md  ,  ,  ) and designed a series of tests targeting subtle and sophisticated edge cases. 

Key aspects tested include:

1. Basic functionality: A simple asm function using a literal with PUSHINT (Test 1) compiled successfully, confirming that literal primitives combined with TVM instructions work as documented.

2. Parameter flattening: We validated that structures (like Pair with fields a and b) are flattened correctly when passed as parameters (Test 2), in line with documentation on struct parameters.

3. Disallowed constructs: Attempts to use a standalone primitive (Test 3) or to reference a parameter identifier directly in the asm body (Test 4) correctly resulted in compilation errors, as these usages violate restrictions outlined in the documentation.

4. Stack arrangements: Both the return arrangement (Test 5) and combined argument/return arrangements (Test 6) were applied. In both cases, the compiler reorders stack elements precisely as per documentation (e.g., the return arrangement ‘-> 1 0’ swaps the top two elements).

5. TVM instructions: The DEPTH instruction was used within an asm function (Test 7) and compiled correctly, confirming that TVM instructions are processed as expected.

6. Placement enforcement: As expected, defining an asm function within a contract (Test 8) yielded a compilation error, enforcing the module-level requirement.

7. Attribute usage: An asm function with both ‘extends’ and ‘mutates’ (Test 9) was allowed per documentation, whereas invalid argument arrangements (Test 10) and insertion of forbidden Tact statements (Test 11) were correctly rejected by the compiler.

8. Advanced struct handling: A nested struct flattening test (Test 12) further confirmed that nested structures are flattened in a right-to-left manner, matching the documented behavior.

Conclusion:
All tests confirmed that the Tact compiler behaves in strict accordance with the official documentation on asm functions. Each of the allowed constructs compiled successfully, while disallowed scenarios produced the expected errors. No additional discrepancies or bugs (beyond known issues) were detected in our extensive asm functions tests.
