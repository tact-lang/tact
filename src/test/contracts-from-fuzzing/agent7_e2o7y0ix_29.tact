No significant issues or discrepancies were detected; the only subtle nuance observed is the need for disambiguating nested generics (e.g., inserting a space between consecutive closing angle brackets when declaring nested maps) and the ephemeral nature of state modifications within getters. With these tests validated, we now continue our systematic exploration of other compiler features.");
