// Final summary: asm functions feature tests for edge cases
//
// We meticulously executed a comprehensive series of tests on asm functions, focusing on the subtleties of TVM instruction usage, arrangements, parameter naming, and spacing. Notably, the following aspects were thoroughly probed:
//
// 1. Valid asm function that pushes a literal using PUSHINT in uppercase â€“ compiled successfully, confirming the expected behavior as documented.
//
// 2. Use of double quotes around TVM instructions resulted in an error (as intended): TVM instructions must be unquoted.
//
// 3. An intentionally mis-cased TVM instruction (e.g., PuShInT) failed compilation error as specified by the case sensitivity rules in the docs.
//
// 4. When using arrangement for return values, the reserved name "self" is disallowed unless used with 'extends'. We resolved this by renaming the parameter appropriately.
//
// 5. Supplying a single primitive without a consuming TVM instruction triggered an appropriate error.
//
// 6. Attempting to use a disallowed attribute (like get) on an asm function produced a compiler error.
//
// 7. Additional tests confirmed that extra spacing is permitted, and the combination of argument/reordering arrangements as documented works correctly.
//
// Throughout these tests, the behavior consistently adhered to the documentation on asm functions, assembly schemes, and arrangement syntax. Each test case was designed to challenge subtle aspects (edge cases) of the feature, and no new discrepancies between the documentation and actual behavior were found.
//
// For further review, see the Tact docs excerpts on asm functions and TVM instructions (e.g., see docs_book_assembly-functions.md sections  - ).
//
// End of asm functions feature testing phase.
