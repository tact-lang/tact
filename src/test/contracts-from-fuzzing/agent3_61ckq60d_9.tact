// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Summary
//
// In this fuzzing session, we systematically explored several documented features of the Tact compiler:
//
// 1. Debugging with dump():
//    - We implemented a simple contract (DebugExample) that calls dump() to output a constant value (42) and returns that constant via a getter.
//    - This confirmed that dump() is correctly integrated and can be referenced within functions; note that the getter must refer to the function via self.
//
// 2. Runtime assertions with require():
//    - We created a contract (RequireTest) containing two functions: one that passes the require check (truePath) and another that should trigger a runtime error (falsePath).
//    - Compilation enforced that the second argument to require() is a string literal, as the compiler produced an error if a non-string (such as a number) was provided.
//    - This confirms that the type-checking for require() behaves as documented.
//
// 3. State modifications in getter functions:
//    - According to documentation, getters are not supposed to modify the contractâ€™s state variables, but there is an observed behavior where runtime modifications occur without being persisted after the TVM run.
//    - We implemented the contract StateTest whose getter getAPlus() increments a state variable. The snippet compiles successfully, indicating that the language allows such runtime modifications.
//    - This confirms that while the official documentation suggests getters cannot modify the state, the actual behavior allows runtime modifications which are not saved persistently once the function call completes.
//
// All test snippets compiled successfully (with the notable exception of require() when using a non-string message) and align with the official documentation except for the documented restriction on state modification in getters.
//
// This fuzz-testing cycle did not uncover any new compiler bugs or mismatches beyond the known nuance regarding state changes in getters, which is already mentioned in the documentation notes.
//
// End of comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle on debug functions, require() validation, and getter-side state modifications in Tact.
