/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
This fuzz-testing cycle targeted the behavior and implementation of maps in Tact, with a focus on their key and value restrictions, serialization options, operations, nested mappings, iteration behavior, and equality semantics. Our approach systematically validated every claim from the official documentation against the actual compiler behavior.

Documentation Basis:
----------------------
According to the official Tact documentation on maps (see   for a detailed discussion of allowed types and operations):

1. Allowed key types are strictly limited to Int and Address. Any attempt to use disallowed types (like String or Struct) should be rejected at compile time.

2. Allowed value types include Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types (structs/messages in permitted contexts). Additionally, serialization for map keys/values is supported solely for Int types with fixed-width formats (e.g. using "as uint8").

3. Documented operations include basic insertion (.set), querying (.get and .exists), updating (.replace and .replaceGet), and deletion (.del, or via setting a key to null), along with equality comparisons—where shallow equality (==) compares underlying cell hashes and deep equality (.deepEquals) performs entry-by-entry comparison.

Testing Summary:
----------------
• Valid Key Types: 
  - Maps using Int and Address as keys (examples: TestMapValid, TestAddressKey) compiled successfully and functioned as expected.
  - Attempts to declare maps with invalid key types (e.g., map<String, Int> in TestInvalidKey, or maps keyed by a Struct as in TestStructKey) were correctly rejected by the compiler, exactly matching the documentation guidelines.

• Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
  - Maps using value types like Int, Bool, and even serialized Int (using 'as uint8') compiled and returned expected results (e.g. TestSerializedMap and TestMapBoolFixed).
  - These tests confirm that serialization is supported solely for Int as documented, while complex types without serialization remain unspecialized.

• Map Operations:
  - Fundamental operations – including .set, .get, .exists, .replace, .replaceGet, and .del – were thoroughly tested (see TestMapOps and TestMapSummary). Each operation produced expected effects (e.g., correct value retrieval, proper deletion when a null is assigned, accurate replacement behavior returning either a boolean or the previous value) exactly as described in the docs.

• Nested Maps & Iteration Constraints:
  - Nested maps were implemented by encapsulating inner maps in structs (e.g., "AllowanceMap") and storing them within an outer map keyed by Address. Iterating over these maps works correctly when they are referenced as valid path expressions (e.g., self.data), while attempts to iterate over maps produced from function calls correctly yield compile-time errors. This behavior aligns with the dangers and limitations outlined in the documentation [ ].

• Equality Comparisons:
  - The differentiation between shallow (==) and deep equality (.deepEquals) was validated. Our tests show that while shallow equality sometimes may report inequality due to differences in underlying serialization, deep equality accurately compares the actual entries. This confirms the documentation’s description (see   for reference).

Conclusion:
-----------
All tested aspects of Tact maps behaved completely in line with the official documentation:

• Key types are strictly enforced to be only Int or Address.
• Value types and their serialization options operate as specified.
• Basic and advanced map operations perform correctly.
• Nested map usages and iteration constraints are correctly enforced.
• Equality semantics differentiate properly between shallow and deep equality comparisons.

No discrepancies or compiler bugs were found in any of the tests conducted. The Tact compiler’s behavior regarding maps faithfully reflects the documented specifications.
