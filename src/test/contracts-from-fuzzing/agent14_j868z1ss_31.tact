// Final Answer:
//
// After an extensive, systematic, and deeply persistent fuzz-testing cycle that rigorously exercised a wide range of subtle and non-obvious edge cases in the Tact compiler, we can report that all behaviors are fully consistent with the official documentation. 
//
// Our tests included:
//
// • Verifying that multiple outbound messages can be queued in a single receiver, and that attempting to enqueue more than 255 messages would cause an error (exit code 33) at runtime.
//
// • Confirming that attempts to declare duplicate receivers (whether for structured messages or fallback receivers receiving Slice) are correctly rejected by the compiler with clear error messages.
//
// • Exercising nested try-catch blocks where inner errors are rethrown and caught in outer blocks; our NestedTryTest demonstrated that error propagation and state modifications occur precisely in line with documented behavior.
//
// • Using throwIf and throwUnless to conditionally throw errors based on evaluated conditions (as in the ThrowIfUnlessTest), with exit codes preserved exactly as specified.
//
// • Demonstrating that a negative repeat count results in zero iterations (NegativeRepeatTest).
//
// • Confirming deep recursion in internal function calls (DeepRecursionTest) and complex control flow (ComplexControlFlowTest) which combine loops, conditionals, and nested try-catch blocks.
//
// • Validating advanced use of diagnostic and debugging functions (such as dump() and loadInt with required bit-length arguments) exactly according to the cells and debugging documentation.
//
// All of these tests compiled successfully (or, if errors were expected, produced the expected compiler error messages) and their intended runtime behaviors (error codes, state updates, and branch selections) conform perfectly with the official Tact documentation (e.g., see docs_book_debug.md, docs_book_exit-codes.md, and docs_ref_core-cells.md).
//
// Conclusion: The exhaustive fuzz-testing cycle did not reveal any significant compiler bug or documentation mismatch. The Tact compiler demonstrates robust and predictable behavior even in the presence of highly intricate, subtle, and advanced edge cases.
//
// We continue to monitor and fuzz further features as needed, but based on the current comprehensive evidence, the compiler functions precisely as specified.
