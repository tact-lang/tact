// Further summary of the fuzz testing for asm functions:

/*
The current cycle has rigorously performed the following test cases:

1. Basic asm function returning a constant: Successful.
2. Case sensitivity for TVM instructions: Non-uppercase usage produces expected error.
3. Primitive without an associated TVM instruction: Produces an error as documented.
4. Parameter usage in asm functions (references interpreted as TVM instructions): Error as expected.
5. Argument arrangement usage (asmStoreDict example): Compiles successfully.
6. Return arrangement swapping (swapReturn using a struct Pair): Compiles successfully.
7. Excessive DROP producing potential underflow: Compiles, but runtime underflow is expected if executed.
8. "mutates" attribute with type mismatch: Compiles, but runtime type-check error expected.
9. Nested struct flattening (sumAB): Compiles successfully.
10. Multiple TVM instructions in sequence (multiStep): Successful.
11. Inline attribute usage and literal encoding (push42, inlineTest): Successful.
12. Arrangement ordering with proper struct signature (asmLoadInt): Successful.
13. Additional tests (excessiveDrop, pushNeg5, push15, complexStackOp): Compile successfully.
14. Additional formatting tests (spacedInstructions, checkDepth, minimalValid): Successful.
15. Further edge cases (pushBoundary, messyFormatting, extra whitespace in arrangement, duplicateInstructions, depthArithmetic) were compiled:
   - duplicateInstructions: Should cause stack underflow if executed, as expected.
16. An asm function using a non-existent TVM instruction (nonExistent): Produces a compilation error as expected.
*/

// All these cases are in accordance with the current documentation of asm functions (aside from known issues, which we are not re-testing).

// Continuing exploration of edge cases to see if any significant bug or documentation mismatch can be identified...

// 31. Testing if combining valid and invalid instructions in a sequence leads to any internal compiler errors
asm fun mixedValidInvalid(): Int {
    10 PUSHINT
    FOOBAR   // non-existent instruction, should error
    20 PUSHINT
    ADD
}

// 32. Testing a scenario of attempting to use a literal string as a TVM instruction
asm fun quotedInstruction(): Int { "PUSHINT" }

// 33. Testing reordering instructions with arrangements when the stack has additional unallocated items
struct CustomPair { first: Int; second: Int }
asm(-> 1 0) fun swapWithExtra(): CustomPair {
    100 PUSHINT   // first value
    200 PUSHINT   // second value
    300 PUSHINT   // extra, unexpected extra value
}

// 34. Testing an asm function with a parameter and then trying to use the same parameter as a TVM instruction
asm fun ambiguityTest(x: Int): Int {
    x
    5 PUSHINT
    ADD
}

// 35. Testing the use of numeric literals in different bases or with underscores, if allowed in TVM instructions
asm fun literalFormats(): Int { 1_000 PUSHINT }

// 36. Testing a sequence of valid TVM instructions that manipulates the stack in a very deep chain
asm fun deepChain(): Int {
    1 PUSHINT
    2 PUSHINT
    ADD
    3 PUSHINT
    ADD
    4 PUSHINT
    ADD
    5 PUSHINT
    ADD
    6 PUSHINT
    ADD
    7 PUSHINT
    ADD
}

// End of further tests
