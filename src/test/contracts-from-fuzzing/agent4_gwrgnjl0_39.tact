/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
Our fuzz-testing cycle on Tact maps (dictionaries) focused on key/value type correctness, serialization behavior, core operations, nested maps, iteration constraints, and equality comparisons. We compared our findings against the official documentation provided in various sections of docs_book_maps.md and docs_book_statements.md. 

Key findings from our tests include:

1. Allowed Key Types:
   - Only Int and Address are accepted as valid keys. We successfully compiled maps declared as map<Int, Int> and map<Address, Int>, while attempts to use disallowed types (like String or user-defined structs) resulted in the expected compile-time errors, in complete agreement with the documentation (see citeturn0file0 and citeturn0file7).

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   - The tests confirmed that allowed value types (Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types) work as documented. In particular, maps with serialized Int types (e.g. using "as uint8") operate correctly as shown by our TestSerializedMap snippet. This adheres to the documentation details regarding serialization (refer to citeturn0file2 and citeturn0file5).

3. Core Map Operations:
   - Fundamental operations such as .set(), .get(), .exists(), .replace(), .replaceGet(), and .del() behaved precisely as expected. Our tests verified that insertion, querying, updates, and deletions all yield the correct outcomes, matching the examples and expectations provided in the official docs (see citeturn0file1 and citeturn0file3).

4. Nested Maps & Iteration:
   - Nested maps are fully supported when accessed as valid path expressions (e.g., self.data). Iteration through foreach only works on such valid references and is appropriately disallowed on maps produced by function calls. This behavior aligns with the documented iteration limitations (see citeturn8file in docs_book_statements.md).

5. Equality Comparisons:
   - Shallow equality (using the '==' operator) and deep equality (using .deepEquals()) were clearly distinguishable in our tests. The shallow comparison only evaluates the underlying serialization, while deepEquals conducts an entry-by-entry comparison, as documented (see citeturn0file7 and citeturn0file4).

6. Edge Cases:
   - Additional tests with Boolean values confirmed that maps can store Bool values, and conditional expressions operate as expected once minor syntactic adjustments are made.

Conclusion:
-----------
Every aspect of our tests confirmed the documented behavior of Tact maps:
   • The compiler enforces key restrictions to only allow Int and Address.
   • Allowed value types, including those with serialization, perform reliably.
   • Map operations function as documented with correct responses for insertion, replacement, deletion, and querying.
   • Nested maps and iteration constraints are upheld.
   • Shallow versus deep equality comparisons work as specified.

No discrepancies or bugs were found. The Tact maps feature works robustly and exactly as described in the official documentation.

Return Value: 0 from our final test contract indicates that all map-related tests passed successfully.
