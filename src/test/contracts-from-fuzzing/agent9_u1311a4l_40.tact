// Comprehensive Final Fuzz-Testing Report on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact

/*
Final Summary:
-------------
Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle on bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts confirms that the compiler behaves precisely as documented. A summary of our key findings is as follows:

1. Standard Usage:
   • Bounce receivers declared with a custom message type (for example, using:
         bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
     ) compile successfully, matching the guidelines found in the bounced messages documentation (see docs_book_bounced.md).

2. Invalid Declarations:
   • Bounce receivers employing an invalid parameter type (e.g., Int or Cell) or those declared without any parameter produce clear compile-time errors. The errors enforce that only types of the form bounced<T>, message, or Slice are acceptable. This confirms that the compiler strictly enforces documented constraints.

3. Fallback Handling:
   • A bounce receiver accepting a raw Slice (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiles without issue and provides a catch-all mechanism for bounced messages. This behavior aligns with the fallback handler recommendations in the documentation.

4. State Modifications:
   • Bounce receivers are permitted to modify contract state (e.g., incrementing a counter), which is verified by our tests. This flexibility is critical for error handling and recovery, setting them apart from getters, which cannot modify state.

5. Conflict Prevention:
   • Attempts to define multiple bounce receivers for the same message type correctly yield a conflict error, enforcing the unique handler requirement as per language specifications.

6. Advanced Control Flow:
   • Incorporating try-catch blocks (with proper syntax) within bounce receivers and constructing recursive or cross-contract interaction patterns (using self.reply() and self.notify()) both compile and behave as expected. This ensures robust support for advanced error handling and message flow.

7. Message Size Limits:
   • Tests designed to exceed the 224 usable data bits limit for bounced messages result in clear compile-time errors, confirming that the compiler enforces this documented constraint rigorously.

Conclusion:
-----------
Every test—from standard scenarios to edge cases—corroborates that the Tact compiler’s handling of bounced messages and bounce receivers is fully compliant with the official documentation. There are no discrepancies or unexpected behaviors found in this feature area.

This robust implementation provides a solid foundation for further development, and our fuzz-testing cycle for bounced messages is now complete. We will continue exploring additional Tact language features in subsequent cycles.
