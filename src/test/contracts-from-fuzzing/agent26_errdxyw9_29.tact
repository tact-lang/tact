Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report: initOf Functionality and Cross-Contract Relationships

Overview:
----------
In this comprehensive testing cycle, we rigorously exercised the Tact compiler’s handling of the initOf expression and its interplay with cross-contract relationships, targeting subtle and non-obvious edge cases. Our test suite included:

1. Simple cross-contract initializations (e.g., one contract obtaining the StateInit of another).
2. Multi-level hierarchical relationships with proper parameter passing – including use of trailing commas – as documented in the expressions and contracts sections (see docs_book_expressions.md and docs_book_contracts.md,   and  ).
3. Complex dependency graphs where multiple initOf calls are composed within structured types, with subsequent address computations (via contractAddress and newAddress) matching runtime addresses (myAddress), in line with the documentation in docs_ref_core-addresses.md (   and  ).
4. Recursive initializations (where a contract calls initOf on itself) and circular dependencies between contracts, which compiled without triggering internal errors, confirming that these constructs are handled as compile-time expressions.
5. Type-safety: Misuse tests (passing an incorrect parameter type) produced compile-time errors exactly as expected, enforcing the language’s static type system.
6. Inline function usage with initOf required proper self-qualification (as seen in our InlineInit tests), which behaved correctly when adjusted.
7. Deep dependency graphs (DeepGraph tests) further challenged the system, and all tests succeeded as documented.

Key Observations:
------------------
• Every correct test case compiled successfully and produced valid StateInit values. 
• Deliberate misuse (e.g., wrong parameter types) reliably generated compile-time errors as specified in the documentation.
• Integration tests linking initOf and address computations confirmed that contractAddress returns the expected results.
• Recursive and circular initializations did not lead to any internal compiler errors.

Conclusion:
-----------
After an exhaustive and systematic fuzz-testing cycle spanning over 20 distinct, creative test cases, all observed compiler behaviors align with official Tact documentation. There are no discrepancies or unexpected behaviors in the implementation of the initOf functionality and the handling of cross-contract relationships.

Future Work:
------------
Further fuzz testing will continue to explore additional compiler features and edge cases, but regarding initOf and its related mechanisms, the implementation is robust and consistent with documented expectations.

Final Report:
-------------
This fuzz-testing cycle confirms that the initOf functionality and cross-contract relationship handling in Tact are implemented as documented, with no significant discrepancies or compiler bugs detected.
