Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
This fuzz-testing cycle focused on thoroughly validating the functionality and constraints of maps in Tact. We explored various aspects of maps in Tact including allowed key/value types, serialization formats, supported operations (insertion, deletion, replacement, querying), nested map usage, iteration rules, and equality comparisons. Our experiments utilized minimal, targeted code snippets that were compiled against the Tact compiler, and our observations were consistently in line with the official Tact documentation.

Documentation Context and Verification:
-----------------------------------------
1. Allowed Key Types:
   - The official documentation (see   and  ) states that only Int and Address are allowed as keys in maps. Our tests using map<Int, Int> and map<Address, Int> compiled successfully, while attempts to use disallowed types (e.g. String or Struct) produced compilation errors.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   - As documented (see  ), maps may hold values of types such as Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types. Moreover, only Int keys (and values, in specialized cases) support serialization formats (e.g. Int as uint8), which was successfully validated in our TestSerializedMap snippet.

3. Core Map Operations:
   - We verified operations such as .set, .get, .exists, .replace, .replaceGet, and .del. These tests (see TestMapOps and TestMapSummary snippets) confirmed that insertion, querying, updating, and deletion behave as specified in the documentation (see   and related sections).

4. Nested Maps & Iteration Constraints:
   - Our tests on nested maps (where an inner map is encapsulated within a struct and then stored in an outer map keyed by Address) showed that iteration through the foreach construct only works when the map is accessed as a valid path expression (e.g. self.data). This aligns with the documentation restrictions (see  ).

5. Equality Comparisons:
   - The distinction between shallow equality (using ==) and deep equality (using .deepEquals()) was confirmed. Our tests revealed that shallow equality compares the underlying cell hashes while .deepEquals() performs an exact entry-by-entry comparison, matching the documented behavior (refer to  ).

6. Boolean Map Values:
   - Maps with Bool as the value type were tested and required minor syntax adjustments (switching to explicit if/else), but ultimately compiled and executed as expected, confirming that Bool is a valid and supported map value type.

Conclusion:
-----------
All our fuzz-testing scenarios have validated that the Tact compiler's implementation of maps adheres strictly to the official documentation. Specifically:

• Only allowed key types (Int and Address) are accepted, with inappropriate key types being rejected at compile time.
• Supported value types, including serialized Int types, function as documented.
• Core map operations perform reliably and as specified.
• Nested map compositions and iteration constraints are properly enforced.
• Equality checks differentiate accurately between shallow and deep comparisons.

No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were observed during this extensive testing cycle. The Tact compiler’s handling of maps is fully consistent with official documentation.
