// Summary of the bounced messages fuzz-testing cycle
//
// We conducted an extensive fuzz-testing cycle focused on undone messages and the bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts.
//
// Our approach included:
// 1. Testing a standard bounced message receiver that accepts a typed bounced message (using a type with a small, constrained field, e.g. Int as uint8).
//    This test confirmed that the compiler accepts bounced receivers as documented (see docs_book_bounced.md citeturn0file0).
//
// 2. Testing a raw bounced message receiver that accepts a Slice, which captures all bounced messages. The snippet compiled successfully, matching the documentation.
//
// 3. Constructing a multi-level bouncing scenario via a bounce chain. In this test, the bounced receiver used self.reply to send a bounced message back with an incremented value. We verified that:
//    - The self.reply alias behaves as documented (see docs_ref_core-base.md citeturn0file1).
//    - The type used in bounced messages must fit within 224 usable data bits; our tests required constraining the field (using uint8) to avoid the compiler error documented in the caveats.
//
// All of our compilation tests compiled as expected (when using appropriate constrained types), and the error cases (when using an overly large field) were consistent with the documentation stipulating a 224-bit limit.
//
// Conclusion: The bounced messages and bounce receiver functionalities in Tact appear to work according to the documentation. There were no unexpected behaviors or compiler bugs detected in these tests. Further fuzz-testing can follow similar creative and thorough approaches to explore other contract functionalities.
//
// End of testing summary.
