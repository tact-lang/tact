// Final Answer Summary for Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Testing in Tact

/*
Overview:

Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle targeted the bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality as documented in Tact. We systematically addressed both standard scenarios and non-obvious edge cases to ensure that the Tact compiler adheres to the specification.

Key Areas Tested:

1. Valid Bounce Receiver Patterns:
   • Bounce receivers defined using the correct syntax (for example, using the wrapper type: bounced(msg: bounced<PingMsg>)) compiled successfully. This validates that the compiler correctly enforces the requirement that bounced messages be wrapped in a specific type, as described in the bounced messages documentation (see  ).
   • Fallback bounce receivers using a raw Slice parameter (e.g. bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) correctly capture all bounced messages—which confirms the design outlined in the contract receivers section (see  ).

2. Invalid Bounce Receiver Declarations:
   • When the bounced wrapper is omitted (i.e. declaring a bounce receiver parameter using a plain message type), the compiler produces a clear compile-time error. This behavior strictly enforces the documented syntax that requires wrapping the bumped message type (as explained in   and  ).
   • Attempts to access a non-existent field (e.g., referencing msg.x when only msg.value is provided) result in a compile-time error, verifying that type safety is maintained.
   • Bounce receiver declarations for a text type (e.g. bounced(msg: bounced<string>)) are rejected, as bounced text messages are not supported per the official documentation.

3. Multi-Contract and Recursive Bouncing Scenarios:
   • We simulated multi-contract bouncing where one contract (BounceChainA) sends a bounce-enabled message to a target contract (BounceChainB) that deliberately lacks a bounce receiver. The message then bounces back as expected to BounceChainA, where its bounce receiver increments a counter. This recursive behavior confirms that the message bouncing mechanism works as described in the documentation (see   and  ).

Conclusion:

Our fuzz-testing cycle confirms that:
   - Valid bounce receiver implementations (both typed and fallback receivers) compile and operate as intended.
   - Erroneous definitions (such as missing the bounced<T> wrapper, referencing incorrect fields, or unsupported text types) reliably produce compile-time errors.
   - Multi-contract bouncing scenarios function as designed, with messages correctly bouncing back due to unhandled incoming calls.

In summary, the Tact compiler’s behavior regarding bounced messages and bounce receivers is fully consistent with the official documentation. No discrepancies or bugs were encountered in our testing.
