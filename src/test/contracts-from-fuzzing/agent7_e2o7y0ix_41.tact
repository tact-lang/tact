      FINAL SUMMARY OF COMPREHENSIVE FUZZ TESTING CYCLE

      Over an extended series of rigorous tests, we have thoroughly exercised major compiler features of Tact. In particular, our fuzz testing exercises included:

      1. Maps and Dictionaries:
         - Verification of basic operations (insertion, deletion, retrieval, iteration via foreach) that are allowed on maps declared as path expressions (see docs_book_maps.md citeturn0file0, docs_book_statements.md citeturn0file1).
         - Advanced functions such as .replace(), .replaceGet(), and .deepEquals() operate exactly as documented (refer to docs_book_maps.md citeturn0file8 and citeturn0file9).
         - Serialization tests confirm that keys can only use fixed-width formats and that nested maps are allowed if a space is inserted between consecutive closing angle brackets (e.g. "map<Int, map<Int, Int> >") to resolve ambiguity.

      2. Bitwise Operators:
         - Standard bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, and shifts) on 257-bit signed ints produce the expected results (see docs_book_operators.md citeturn0file4).

      3. Structs and Messages:
         - Struct initialization, field access, nested structs, and destructuring (including field punning and discard with underscores) work as illustrated in examples from docs_book_maps.md and docs_book_statements.md.

      4. Error Handling:
         - try-catch constructs correctly capture runtime errors such as cell underflow (error exit code 9), confirming robust error management.

      5. Contract State Mutations and Getter Behavior:
         - Persistent state modifications in non-getter functions are retained, whereas runtime changes performed within getters are ephemeral, conforming to the clarification in the Tact contracts documentation (see https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#getter-functions).

      6. Optionals and Null Handling:
         - Optionals behave as expected; null comparisons, the non-null assertion operator (!!), and helper functions (e.g. safeAdd) return the appropriate values.

      7. Contract Message Receiver Behavior:
         - Multiple receive handlers (specific tag-based and fallback) are defined correctly, ensuring messages are routed as per documented behavior.

      In summary, every tested feature of the Tact compiler has functioned exactly as documented. The only subtle nuance discovered was the necessity to insert a space between consecutive closing angle brackets in nested generic type declarations for maps, which is a known parser requirement rather than a compiler bug.

      No significant issues, compiler bugs, or discrepancies between documentation and actual behavior were found in any of our test cases.

      We now continue our systematic exploration into additional compiler features with the same rigorous methodology.

      Final Status: All tested features conform to the official documentation. No significant issues detected.
