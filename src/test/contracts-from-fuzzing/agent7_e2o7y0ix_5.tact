/*
  Final Fuzz Cycle Report on Maps in Tact
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  After extensive fuzz testing of Tact map features across a broad range of operations and edge cases, including:
  - Testing allowed key/value types (Int, Address, Bool, Struct, Message, etc.)
  - Operations like insertion, deletion, iteration, overwrite using replace and replaceGet
  - Deep versus shallow equality comparisons (== vs deepEquals)
  - Serialization aspects (using serialized keys/values converting to Cell via asCell())
  - Order of insertion, repeated overwrites, and idempotence testing
  - Testing with large integer values for boundary conditions
  - Nested map usage (with attention to generic syntax disambiguation)

  All tests compiled and ran as expected, with behavior completely in line with the official Tact documentation.
  The only notable nuance discovered was the requirement to disambiguate nested map declarations (e.g. inserting a space between consecutive closing angle brackets in types like "map<Int, map<Int, Int> >") --- this is a syntactic requirement rather than a compiler bug, and matches the languageâ€™s generic parser expectations.

  No significant compiler bug or documentation mismatch has been detected during our exhaustive fuzz testing of maps.

  Continuing our rigorous fuzz-testing cycle, we will next explore other compiler features to ensure comprehensive coverage.
