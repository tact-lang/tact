Getter Functions Fuzz Testing Analysis Summary

During our continued comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle, we focused on verifying the behavior of getter functions regarding state modifications. The official Tact documentation (as seen in docs_book_contracts.md   and  ) claims that getter functions "cannot modify the contract’s state variables; they can only read their values and use them in expressions." 

To validate this claim, we created two contract variants:

1. TestGetterRead – a straightforward getter that returns a state variable without modification:

    contract TestGetterRead {
        bar: Int;

        init() {
            self.bar = 42;
        }

        get fun getBar(): Int {
            return self.bar;
        }
    }

2. TestGetterModification – a getter that intentionally modifies the state variable (by incrementing it) prior to returning the value:

    contract TestGetterModification {
        foo: Int;

        init() {
            self.foo = 0;
        }

        get fun getFoo(): Int {
            self.foo = self.foo + 1;
            return self.foo;
        }
    }

Our fuzz tests confirmed that:

• The TestGetterModification contract compiles successfully, even though it contains a state modification in its getter function.

• Upon invocation, getFoo() returns an incremented value (e.g. 1 on the first call), demonstrating that the modification occurs during the execution of the getter.

• However, after the TVM execution completes, the changes made inside the getter are not persisted to the contract’s storage. This means that while the runtime output reflects the modified state during the execution, persistent state remains unchanged.

This behavior reveals a subtle but important nuance: although the documentation suggests that getters are read-only with respect to contract state, in practice the execution environment allows temporary modifications that are discarded after execution. Therefore, developers should not use getters to reliably update state and should instead employ dedicated state-mutating functions.

This detailed behavior is critical to understand and aligns with our deep fuzz-testing results. For further details on getter functions and their constraints, consult the Tact documentation in docs_book_contracts.md   and  .
