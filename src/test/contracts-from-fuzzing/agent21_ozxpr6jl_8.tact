// Comprehensive Testing Report for asm functions
// =====================================================
// Our testing cycle for asm functions involved the following tests:
//
// Test 1: Minimal asm function with TVM instruction -
//   asm fun answer(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }
//   Outcome: Compiled successfully, confirming correct handling of TVM instruction primitives.
//
// Test 2: Using a primitive without a consuming TVM instruction -
//   asm fun withoutInstruction(): Int { 43 }
//   Outcome: Compilation error as expected. This matches the documented requirement that every primitive must be attached to a TVM instruction.
//
// Test 3: Invalid usage of parameter name (attempting to reference a parameter directly in the body) -
//   asm fun bocchiThe(BOC: Cell): Cell { BOC }
//   Outcome: Compilation error because the parameter name is interpreted as a TVM instruction. This behavior is as documented.
//
// Test 4: Examining asm rearrangement clause requirements: 
//   Attempt was made with incomplete arrangement:
//      asm(a -> 1 0) fun swapPair(a: Int, b: Int): Pair { SWAP }
//   Outcome: Compilation error, message: "asm argument rearrangement must mention all function parameters". This confirms that the compiler strictly requires all parameters to be mentioned in rearrangement arrangements.
//
// Test 5: asm function with DEPTH TVM instruction:
//   asm fun checkDepth(): Int { DEPTH }
//   Outcome: Successfully compiled, correctly capturing the stack depth. 
//
// Test 6: asm function using a flattened struct parameter:
//   struct AB { a: Int; b: Int }
//   asm fun sumAB(two: AB): Int { ADD }
//   Outcome: Successfully compiled and operates as expected, summing the two fields of the struct.
//
// References from the documentation were retrieved via file search responses (citations:   through  ). 
//
// Summary: All the tests performed have behaved exactly in line with the official documented behavior of asm functions. We have focused on subtle aspects such as parameter rearrangement, handling of primitives, and stack manipulation, and no deviations from the Tact documentation have been uncovered in this cycle.
//
// Next steps: Continue further extensive edge-case testing as needed to explore additional intricate scenarios while remaining clear of known issues. Until a definite mismatch or bug is found, we continue meticulous inspection per our fuzz-testing strategy.
