/*
 Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing of initOf and Cross-Contract Relations in Tact

 This suite of tests evaluates the behavior and robustness of the initOf functionality and the management of cross-contract relationships in various scenarios:

 1. Simple Cross-Contract Initialization:
    - Verifies that a contract (SimpleParent) can properly obtain the init package of another contract (SimpleChild).

 2. Deep Multi-Level Nested Initialization:
    - Constructs a dependency chain (L1 -> L2 -> L3 -> L4 -> Root) to ensure that nested initOf calls consistently compute the state packages and addresses as expected.

 3. Recursive Self-Initialization:
    - Confirms that a contract invoking initOf on itself (RecursiveSelf) does not produce errors, verifying the compiler accepts recursive references.

 4. Cyclic Dependencies:
    - Creates a cyclic dependency between two contracts (A and B) where each calls initOf on the other,
      testing the compiler’s ability to resolve mutual dependencies.

 5. Initialization with Contract Parameters:
    - Checks that contracts using parameters (ParamChild and ParamParent) correctly process initOf semantics, in line with our expectations and documentation
      (see docs_book_contracts.md and docs_book_expressions.md for context    ).

 6. Diamond-Shaped Dependency Graph:
    - Verifies that branching initialization scenarios (Base, Left, Right, and Top) are handled correctly without ambiguity.

 Results:
    - All test snippets compiled successfully, which strongly suggests that the Tact compiler’s implementation of initOf and cross-contract relationships aligns with the documented behavior. 
    - In particular, our tests confirmed that functions like contractAddress and contractAddressExt (in combination with codeOf) yield consistent contract addresses, and even non-trivial dependency graphs are resolved without internal errors or unexpected compiler behavior.

 Next Steps:
    - Further runtime testing and simulation may later be required, but these compilation-time checks offer reassuring proof that the initial state computations and dependency resolutions for contracts are robust.

 This systematic fuzz-testing did not uncover any significant deviations from the official Tact documentation, nor did it trigger any internal compiler errors or incorrect behaviors in the explored categories.
