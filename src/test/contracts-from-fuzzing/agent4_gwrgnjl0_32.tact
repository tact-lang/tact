/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
This fuzz-testing cycle was dedicated to rigorously validating the Tact compiler’s behavior for maps (dictionaries). Our investigation focused on:
 • Allowed key and value types
 • Serialization behavior (for Int keys/values)
 • Core map operations: insertion (.set), querying (.get, .exists), updating (.replace, .replaceGet), and deletion (.del)
 • Nested map usage and iteration restrictions
 • Shallow versus deep equality comparisons

Documentation Reference:
------------------------
We based our tests on the official Tact documentation. In particular, the docs on maps in docs_book_maps.md detail that:
  1. Allowed key types are strictly limited to Int and Address [ ].
  2. Allowed value types include Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types. Serialization is available for Int types only [ ].
  3. Map operations (.set, .get, .exists, .replace, .replaceGet, .del) behave as described, with additional guidance on comparing maps deepEquals versus shallow equality (==) [ ].

Test Summary:
-------------
1. Allowed Key Types:
   - Valid maps such as map<Int, Int> and map<Address, Int> were compiled and executed successfully (see TestMapValid and TestAddressKey).
   - Attempts to declare maps using invalid key types such as String or a Struct (TestInvalidKey and TestStructKey) were correctly rejected.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   - Maps with value types like Int, Bool, and serialized Int (using "as uint8") compiled and functioned as expected (demonstrated by TestSerializedMap and TestMapBoolFixed), confirming that only Int keys (and values) support serialization formats.

3. Core Map Operations:
   - Our tests for operations (TestMapOps and TestMapSummary) showed that .set, .get, .exists, .replace, .replaceGet, and .del work correctly, returning proper booleans, old values, and modifying the map state in accordance with the documentation.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration Restrictions:
   - Nested maps were constructed by embedding an inner map within a struct (e.g., AllowanceMap) and then using an outer map keyed by Address. Iteration via foreach worked only when referencing state variables (e.g. self.data) as required by documentation, and misuse of iteration (e.g., iterating over maps returned from function calls) produced compile-time errors.

5. Equality Comparisons:
   - We confirmed that the shallow equality operator (==) compares the underlying serialized hash of a map, whereas .deepEquals() performs a complete, key-by-key comparison. This distinction was clearly validated in TestMapDeepEquals.

Conclusion:
-----------
All tests performed during this comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle indicate that the Tact compiler’s implementation of maps adheres completely to the documented specifications. Specifically:

 • Only Int and Address are allowed as keys; any deviation results in clear compile-time errors.
 • Allowed value types, including serialization for Int types, function properly.
 • Map operations including insertion, deletion, replacement, and querying work as expected.
 • Nested maps and the restrictions on iteration (only allowing valid path expressions) are correctly enforced.
 • The difference between shallow equality (==) and deep equality (.deepEquals) is maintained as specified.

No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were found. The behavior of maps in the Tact compiler is in full compliance with the official documentation [ ].
