// Comprehensive Final Answer: Fuzz-Testing of Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact

/*
Final Summary Report:
---------------------

Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle on bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts has rigorously assessed every aspect of this feature. We generated a variety of minimal code snippets to exercise both typical usage scenarios and a broad range of edge cases, and here are our key findings:

1. Standard Usage:
   • Bounce receivers declared with a custom message type (for example, using:
         bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
     ) compile successfully. This confirms that the basic usage complies with the official documentation on bounced messages (see  ).

2. Invalid Declarations:
   • Bounce receivers defined with incorrect parameter types (such as Int or Cell) or those without any parameter produce clear compile-time errors. These errors explicitly dictate that only parameters of type bounced<T>, message, or Slice are allowed, which aligns perfectly with the language specification (refer to  ).

3. Fallback Handling:
   • Bounce receivers that accept a raw Slice (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compile without issues, thereby providing a catch-all mechanism to handle any bounced messages as documented (see  ).

4. State Modifications:
   • Bounce receivers can modify contract state (for instance, incrementing a counter) without issues. This demonstrates that bounce receivers are allowed to update state, in contrast to getter functions which must remain read-only. This behavior is consistent with the intended design described in the contracts documentation (see  ).

5. Unique Receiver Enforcement:
   • Attempts to declare multiple bounce receivers for the same message type correctly result in conflict errors, ensuring an unambiguous one-to-one mapping between a message type and its receiver, as expected by the language design.

6. Advanced Control Flow:
   • Incorporation of try-catch blocks (with the correct syntax) within bounce receivers compiles successfully, and advanced recursive or cross-contract interactions—using self.reply() and self.notify()—behave as documented for outbound messaging (see  ).

7. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
   • Tests attempting to operate on bounced messages that exceed the 224 usable data bits limit trigger appropriate compile-time errors. This strict enforcement confirms that the Tact compiler adheres to the documented message size constraints (discussed in  ).

Conclusion:
-----------
Every test case, ranging from standard valid usage to aggressive edge-case scenarios and error conditions, demonstrates that the Tact compiler’s handling of bounced messages and bounce receivers matches exactly the official documentation. No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were observed.

This confirms that the bounce receiver feature in Tact is robust, reliable, and implemented exactly as specified. Future fuzz-testing cycles will now shift focus to other advanced features of the language.
