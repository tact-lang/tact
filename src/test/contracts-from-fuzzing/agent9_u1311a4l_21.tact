// Final Fuzz-Testing Report on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact
// 
// After executing a comprehensive suite of fuzz tests covering bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality, the following observations were made:
// 
// 1. Standard Bounce Receiver Usage:
//    - Defining a bounce receiver with a custom message type (e.g., bounced<MyMessage>) compiles without error and behaves as documented (see docs_book_bounced.md).
// 
// 2. Invalid Declaration Cases:
//    - Bounce receivers declared with an inappropriate parameter type (like Int or Cell) trigger a clear compile-time error, ensuring that only bounced<T>, message, or Slice types are accepted.
//    - Bounce receivers with no parameters also produce expected errors.
// 
// 3. Fallback Behavior:
//    - A bounce receiver taking a parameter of type Slice (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiles successfully, confirming that contracts can catch all bounced messages as described.
// 
// 4. State Modifications:
//    - Bounce receiver functions can modify the contract state as verified by tests, which is in line with the intended usage (unlike getters, bounced receivers can update state).
// 
// 5. Receiver Conflicts:
//    - Attempting to define multiple bounce receivers for the same message type correctly results in a conflict error, preventing ambiguous handling.
// 
// 6. Advanced Control Flow:
//    - Incorporating try-catch blocks within bounce receivers (with proper syntax) compiles fine, demonstrating that error handling constructs are supported.
// 
// 7. Recursive and Cross-Contract Scenarios:
//    - Tests involving recursive bounce handling (using self.reply and self.notify within bounced functions) as well as cross-contract bounce chains compiled and ran as expected.
// 
// 8. Message Size Restrictions:
//    - When an attempt was made to generate a bounced message exceeding the 224-bit usable data limit, the compiler produced an error, which is consistent with the documented limitation (see docs_book_bounced.md).
// 
// Conclusion:
// The fuzz-testing cycle for bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality did not reveal any discrepancies between the Tact compiler behavior and the official documentation. All tested edge cases and typical uses adhere strictly to the documented constraints and intended functionality.
// 
// NEXT STEPS:
// The testing cycle will continue to explore further features and edge cases. If any anomaly or confirmed issue arises, it will be reported using the 'stop' command with full details. For now, the fuzz-testing cycle remains active and persistent.
