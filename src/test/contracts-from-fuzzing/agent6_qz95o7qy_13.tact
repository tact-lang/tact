/*
Fuzz-Testing Cycle Summary for Tact Structs Feature

This test suite thoroughly exercises the various aspects of Tact structs as documented.

Tests Executed:
1) Basic Struct Instantiation:
   - Defined a simple struct (Point) and instantiated it with valid field assignments. (See docs on [Structs and Messages](https://tact-lang.org/book/structs-and-messages))

2) Default Field Values:
   - Created a struct (DefaultParams) with default field values and instantiated it without providing explicit values.

3) Nested Structs:
   - Defined nested structs (Curved containing a Point) and validated that nested instantiation works as expected.

4) Field Punning:
   - Used local variables whose names coincide with the struct field names (PopQuiz) to test the field punning feature.

5) Out-of-Order Field Instantiation:
   - Instantiated a struct (OutOfOrder) by providing fields in an order different from declaration order, confirming that instantiation is name-based rather than positional.

6) Error Cases - Missing Fields:
   - Attempted to instantiate a struct missing a required field (MissingField), and the compiler produced a "Missing field" error.

7) Error Cases - Extra Fields:
   - Attempted to instantiate a struct with an extra field (ExtraField); the compiler correctly reported an "Unknown fields" error.

8) Destructuring Assignment:
   - Verified that destructuring assignment correctly unpacks fields from a struct instance, as documented.

9) Circular Dependency Detection:
   - Confirmed that mutually recursive types (struct A referencing B and vice versa) are rejected, in line with documentation that circular types are disallowed.

10) Syntax Detail - Trailing Semicolon:
   - Verified that field separators need to be semicolons in struct declarations, even though the trailing semicolon is optional, following the examples provided in documentation.

11) 'as remaining' Field Placement:
   - Ensured that a field declared with 'as remaining' must be the last in the struct, with errors raised when this rule is violated.

All observed behaviors are in full alignment with the official Tact documentation (see, e.g., docs_book_structs-and-messages.md   and docs_book_types.md  ).

Conclusion: No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were observed during this exhaustive series of tests. The Tact compiler correctly supports struct features, including default values, nested instantiation, field punning, destructuring assignments, and proper error reporting for invalid struct configurations.

    // - Circular dependency (mutually recursive structs) is not permitted.
    // - A field with 'as remaining' must be last in a struct.
