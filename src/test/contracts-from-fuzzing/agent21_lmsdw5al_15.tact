// Final Answer: Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing of initOf and Cross-Contract Relationships

/*
Overview:
---------
We conducted an extensive fuzz-testing cycle aimed at evaluating the behavior of the initOf expression and its associated cross-contract initialization functionalities in Tact. We systematically crafted and compiled a suite of minimal Tact snippets addressing several scenarios, including:

1. Simple Cross-Contract Initialization:
   - A parent contract invokes initOf on a basic child contract and computes its address using contractAddress. The test compiled successfully, confirming that basic cross-contract initialization functions as per the documentation.

2. Multi-Level Parent-Child Relationships:
   - A three-level contract hierarchy (GrandChild → Child → Parent) was created. Each contract in the hierarchy used initOf for the child and calculated the address via contractAddress, with every level compiling cleanly.

3. Recursive Initialization:
   - A contract called initOf on itself to obtain its own StateInit and compute its address. This test, which checks self-referential initialization, passed without errors.

4. Mutual Recursive Initialization:
   - Two contracts (A and B) reference each other through mutual initOf calls. The circular dependency resolved without issues, and both contracts compiled successfully.

5. Deep Nested Contract Graph:
   - A deeply nested contract graph spanning five levels (from Level0 to Level4) was tested. At each level, initOf was used to initialize the next contract, and all snippets compiled as expected.

6. Parameterized Contracts:
   - Contracts with parameters (e.g., ParamContract) were exercised using initOf from both the contract’s own receiver and from an external contract (TestParam). This confirmed that parameterized initializations work seamlessly with initOf.

Documentation References and Observations:
------------------------------------------
The tested scenarios were inspired by the official Tact documentation (see, for example, docs_book_expressions.md   and docs_ref_core-addresses.md  ) which describe initOf, the construction of the StateInit package, and its usage with functions like contractAddress.

All snippets compiled without errors or warnings, and no unexpected behavior was observed. Recursive, mutual recursive, and deeply nested initializations all behaved consistently with the documentation.

Conclusion:
-----------
The comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle for initOf and cross-contract relationships in Tact confirms that the compiler adheres to the documented specifications. In every edge-case—including simple usage, multi-level and nested relationships, recursion (both direct and mutual), and parameterized contract initialization—the actual compiler behavior aligns with the official documentation.

Therefore, our testing finds no discrepancies or anomalies, and the initOf functionality, along with its related constructs (e.g., contractAddress), operates robustly and as expected.
