// Summary of Fuzz-Testing Cycle for initOf and Cross-Contract Relationships in Tact
//
// This summary describes the series of test cases executed to rigorously examine the behavior
// of the initOf expression in various contract initialization scenarios and the associated
// functions (e.g., contractAddress).
//
// Test Cases:
//
// 1. Simple Cross-Contract Initialization:
//    - A contract (SimpleChild) was initialized through a parent contract (SimpleParent).
//    - The parent's receive() function calls initOf SimpleChild() to obtain its StateInit,
//      and then computes its address using contractAddress.
//    - Expected behavior: The snippet compiles successfully and produces the expected result.
//
// 2. Multi-Level Parent-Child Relationships:
//    - A hierarchy was created (GrandChild -> Child -> Parent).
//    - Each level uses initOf to compute the initial state of its child, followed by calculating its contract address.
//    - Outcome: All levels compile without error, verifying multi-level initOf behavior.
//
// 3. Recursive Initialization:
//    - A contract (Recursive) invokes initOf on itself.
//    - This tests whether self-referential initial state computation works as intended.
//    - Outcome: The snippet compiles, confirming that recursive self-initialization is permitted.
//
// 4. Mutual Recursive Initialization:
//    - Two contracts (A and B) reference each other via initOf.
//    - Each contract calls initOf on the other, testing circular reference resolution.
//    - Outcome: Both contracts compile, demonstrating that mutual recursion in initOf is handled gracefully.
//
// 5. Deep Nested Contract Graph:
//    - A chain of five levels (Level0 through Level4) was created.
//    - Each contract computes the initial state of its child contract and calculates its address.
//    - Outcome: The deeply nested structure compiled successfully, evidenced by the absence of error messages.
//
// 6. Parameterized Contracts:
//    - A contract with contract parameters (ParamContract) was tested.
//    - Both a direct use in its own receiver and an external call from TestParam were validated via initOf with different parameter values.
//    - Outcome: Compilation succeeded, confirming correct handling of contract parameters with initOf.
//
// References in Documentation:
// The tested functionalities are in line with the sections for the initOf expression and contractAddress functions as described in the Tact documentation (e.g. docs_book_expressions.md and docs_ref_core-addresses.md  ,  ,  ).
//
// Conclusion:
// All test cases compiled successfully, suggesting that the current implementation of initOf and cross-contract initialization
// adheres to the documented specifications. No discrepancies between the documentation and observed compiler behavior were found,
// even in complex, recursive, and deeply nested scenarios.
