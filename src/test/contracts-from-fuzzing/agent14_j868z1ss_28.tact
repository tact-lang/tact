// Final Fuzz-Testing Summary: Extended Advanced Features
//
// After a rigorous, systematic, and exhaustive fuzz-testing cycle, we have deeply explored a wide range of subtle and complex edge cases within the Tact compiler. Our tests have included:
//
// 1. Multiple outbound actions in a receiver (using self.reply) and verifying that queuing >255 messages is gracefully constrained (exit code 33 at runtime).
//
// 2. Duplicate receiver definitions: both for structured and fallback receivers, which were properly rejected by the compiler with explicit error messages.
//
// 3. Nested try-catch blocks that rethrow errors (NestedTryTest) and advanced error conditional throwing, via throwIf/throwUnless (ThrowIfUnlessTest), confirming that error propagation and state rollbacks work as documented.
//
// 4. Negative iteration repeat loops (NegativeRepeatTest) confirming that a non-positive repeat count leads to zero execution of the loop block.
//
// 5. Deep recursion (DeepRecursionTest) verifying that internal recursive function calls are handled correctly up to significant depths.
//
// 6. Complex control flows combining conditionals, repeat loops, and nested try-catch blocks (ComplexControlFlowTest) that resulted in the expected state modifications under all branches.
//
// 7. Additional tests involving advanced use of Tactâ€™s debugging functions, such as dump() and nested exception handling, further confirm that error codes (including those thrown by throw, throwIf and throwUnless) precisely follow documentation.
//
// In every instance, the Tact compiler behaved consistently with the official documentation. All parts of the language, including error handling, control structures, and action queuing, were either compiled successfully or rejected with the correct and expected compiler error messages where applicable.
//
// Conclusion: No significant compiler bug or documentation mismatch has been identified in this extended fuzz-testing cycle. The advanced and subtle edge cases we tested all conform to the documented behavior of the Tact compiler. We will continue exploratory fuzz-testing as needed, but up to this point, our comprehensive testing confirms the robustness and accuracy of the compiler.
