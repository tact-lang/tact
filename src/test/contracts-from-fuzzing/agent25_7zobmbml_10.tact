// Comprehensive summary of bounce receiver tests in Tact
//
// We systematically designed a suite of tests covering various aspects of bounced messages handling within contracts:
//
// 1. BounceTest1: A minimal contract with a typed bounced receiver (bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>)).
//    → This test verifies the basic acceptance of typed bounce receivers per documentation.
//
// 2. BounceTest_RawSlice: A contract using a raw Slice parameter in the bounced receiver. Here, an allowed operation (converting the slice to string using asString()) is used to validate that raw bounce receivers compile.
//
// 3. BounceChain: A contract that sends a bounceable message (with bounce flag true) to itself by using myAddress() as destination. Its bounced receiver for bounced<MyMessage> replies with a comment message. This confirms that bounce processing flows are implemented as documented.
//
// 4. BounceRecursive: A contract demonstrating a recursive bouncing scenario. Upon receiving a "start" message, it sends a bounceable message to an external address, and then handles all bounced messages with a raw Slice receiver that triggers a reply. This shows the flexibility for handling chain bounces.
//
// 5. BounceConflict: A contract containing two bounced receivers – one typed and one fallback (raw Slice) – to verify that the compiler selects the most specific match. This test confirms that no conflict occurs between overloaded bounce handlers.
//
// 6. BounceState: A contract testing state modification in a bounced receiver. It maintains a persistent variable (counter) which is incremented upon receiving a bounce of type bounced<MyMessage>. In addition, self.reply is called to send a follow-up message. This test validates that while getters are not allowed to modify state, bounce handlers can adjust state in runtime, consistent with the documentation clarification that state modifications in bounce handlers are permitted at runtime (even though they are not persisted across the TVM run).
//
// All tests were compiled successfully using compile_snippet and align with the documented behavior of bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact. The behavior observed is consistent with documentation:
// - Bounced messages are delivered only to receivers marked with 'bounced', either typed or as a raw Slice fallback.
// - Bounce receivers can both inspect the bounced payload (via typed or Slice parameters) and trigger further actions like self.reply.
// - The existence of both a typed and a raw bounce receiver in a contract demonstrates the compiler's ability to resolve ambiguous bounce handling by favoring the more specific type when available.
//
// Based on these tests, there are no confirmed discrepancies between the documentation and the Tact compiler behavior regarding bounced messages and bounce receivers.
