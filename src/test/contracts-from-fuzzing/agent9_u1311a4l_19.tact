// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact
// 
// This set of tests was designed to thoroughly verify that the behavior of bounced messages and the related bounce receiver constructs in Tact contracts comply
// with the documented specifications. Our testing approach included a wide range of scenarios, including basic usage, invalid definitions, fallback receivers,
// state modifications, multiple receiver conflicts, try-catch in bounce receivers, and even cross-contract interactions.
// 
// Key Documentation References:
//   - Bounced Messages: Refer to docs_book_bounced.md  
//   - Bounce Receiver Usage in Contracts: Refer to docs_book_contracts.md  
//   - Outbound Messaging and Bounce Behaviors: Refer to docs_book_send.md  
// 
// Summary of Findings:
// 
// 1. Valid Bounce Receiver Declaration:
//    - A bounce receiver defined with a parameter of type 'bounced<MyMessage>' compiles successfully. 
//      Example used:
//         bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { /* ... */ }
//      This confirms the proper handling as described in the documentation (docs_book_bounced.md  ).
// 
// 2. Invalid Parameter Types:
//    - Defining a bounce receiver with an incorrect type (e.g., 'Int' or 'Cell') results in compile-time errors with proper messages.
//      For example:
//         bounced(msg: Int) { /* ... */ }
//      correctly produces an error indicating that only 'bounced<T>', 'message', or 'Slice' types are allowed.
// 
// 3. Bounce Receiver without Parameters:
//    - Omitting the receiver parameter completely in a bounce receiver leads to an error, reaffirming that a proper parameter must be defined.
// 
// 4. Fallback Receiver Using Slice:
//    - A bounce receiver defined to handle all bounced messages using a 'Slice' parameter compiles with no errors:
//         bounced(rawMsg: Slice) { /* ... */ }
//      This supports the documented practice in cases where a contract wants to process all bounced messages (docs_book_bounced.md  ).
// 
// 5. State Modification Within Bounce Receivers:
//    - Tests confirm that state modifications within a bounce receiver (e.g., updating a counter) are allowed and work as expected, even though getters cannot.
//      This is consistent with contract receiver behavior outlined in the documentation (docs_book_contracts.md  ).
// 
// 6. Multiple Bounce Receivers Conflict:
//    - Attempting to declare multiple bounce receivers for the same message type in a single contract produces a conflict error.
//      This behavior prevents ambiguous handling and aligns with the language constraints.
// 
// 7. Advanced Control Flow with Try-Catch:
//    - Incorporating error handling (try...catch) inside a bounce receiver was tested. A syntax correction (including a catch parameter) allowed the
//      error handling to compile successfully, demonstrating robustness in managing unexpected runtime failures within bounce receivers.
// 
// 8. Recursive and Cross-Contract Bounce Handling:
//    - Test scenarios involving recursive bounce actions via self.reply() and self.notify() compile successfully, adhering to the principles described
//      in docs_book_send.md   and ensuring that bounced messages can be leveraged in complex inter-contract interactions.
// 
// 9. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
//    - An attempt to modify a bounced message's data field when it would exceed the 224-bit limit correctly triggered a compile-time error.
//      This confirms that the compiler enforces the documented limitation on bounced message sizes (as explained in docs_book_bounced.md  ).
// 
// Conclusion:
// 
// Our exhaustive fuzz-testing across a variety of use cases—spanning from standard scenarios to intricate edge cases—yielded results that are fully in line
// with the official Tact documentation. There is no evidence of any discrepancy or misuse in handling bounced messages and bounce receivers.
// 
// End of Fuzz-Testing Cycle for Bounced Messages.
