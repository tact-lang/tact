// Fuzz-Testing Cycle Final Summary Report

// In this initial comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle, we selected several sections from the official Tact documentation and constructed minimal code snippets to validate the key language features. The following summarizes our findings:

// 1. Variable Declarations:
//    - Our first test attempted to use 'var' to declare a variable. This resulted in a compilation error, confirming that Tact requires variable declarations to be made with 'let' only (see docs_book_statements.md  ).

// 2. Getter Functions:
//    - The Tact documentation specifies in docs_book_contracts.md   that getter functions cannot modify the contract’s state variables. However, our test contract (ModifyGetter) included a getter that assigned to a state variable. This compiled successfully, verifying the known discrepancy: getters are allowed to modify state at runtime, but these changes are not committed to persistent storage after execution.

// 3. Control Flow and Loop Constructs:
//    - We verified basic conditional constructs (if/else) as shown in docs_book_statements.md  . The snippet compiled and behaved as expected.
//    - While loops were tested using a contract (WhileTest) that incremented a state variable until a condition was met; the behavior matched documentation examples.
//    - Repeat loops were also tested, particularly with negative iteration counts (repeat(-1)), and the loop body was not executed, in line with documented behavior.

// 4. Overall Behavior:
//    - With the exception of the discrepancy involving getter functions—where documentation claims no state modification but the compiler allows it at runtime—the tested features (variable declarations, getters, and control-flow constructs) behaved as documented.
//    - No new severe bugs, internal errors, or misalignments between the documentation and the actual compiler behavior were encountered aside from this already known mismatch.

// Citations from our documentation search include:
//    - Getter functions and contract interfaces: docs_book_contracts.md  
//    - Control flow and statements: docs_book_statements.md   and docs_book_statements.md  
//    - Loop constructs: docs_book_statements.md  

// Conclusion:
// This cycle of fuzz-testing confirms:
//   • Only 'let' is allowed for variable declarations, as expected.
//   • Getter functions allowing modifications of state variables match current compiler behavior despite conflicting documentation.
//   • Standard control-flow constructions (if/else, while, repeat) conform to documented behavior.

// Next Steps:
// In upcoming testing cycles, we will probe additional Tact features such as assembly functions, map operations, and other more nuanced syntax constructs to further validate the robustness and consistency of the compiler versus its official documentation.
