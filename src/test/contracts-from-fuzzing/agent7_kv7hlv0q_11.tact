// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report

// Overview:
// In this fuzz-testing cycle, we thoroughly examined several sections of the official Tact documentation using minimal code snippets. The goals were to:
//   • Verify that documented language features (like variable declarations, getter functions, control-flow constructs, and loops) compile and behave as expected.
//   • Validate detailed claims such as: getter functions should only access (read) state (even though runtime modifications are allowed but non-persistent), and loop constructs (while, repeat, etc.) behave in line with their documented semantics.
//   • Confirm that syntax rules (e.g., the absence of the 'var' keyword) are enforced by the compiler.
//
// Key Findings:
//
// 1. Variable Declarations:
//    - Our initial test attempting to declare a variable using 'var' resulted in a compilation error, which confirms that Tact requires variable declarations to be made using 'let' only. This behavior complies with the language design.
//
// 2. Getter Functions and State Mutations:
//    - The documentation explicitly states that getter functions "cannot modify the contract’s state variables; they can only read their values and use them in expressions." (see documentation in docs_book_contracts.md  ).
//    - Our test with a getter function in the contract ModifyGetter, where the getter modified the state variable, compiled successfully. This confirms the known discrepancy where getters may modify state at runtime – although such modifications are not persisted after the TVM execution. This subtle deviation has been noted in previous observations. 
//
// 3. Control Flow and Loop Constructs:
//    - The while loop test (in contract WhileTest) validated that Tact’s while loop increments a state variable as long as a condition holds true (cf. typical control flow examples in docs_book_statements.md  ). 
//    - The repeat loop was tested with both valid (positive count) and invalid (negative count) iteration numbers. For example, using repeat(-1) resulted in the loop body being skipped, which is in accordance with the documentation (repeat loops execute only when provided a positive iteration count, see docs_book_statements.md  ).
//    - Standard if/else constructions compiled without any issue, further confirming that conditional constructs are implemented as documented.
//
// Conclusion:
//
// This cycle of fuzz-testing did not reveal any new severe issues or additional discrepancies beyond what has been previously observed. The Tact compiler behavior aligns with the documentation in the following ways:
//   • Variable declarations must use 'let', as evidenced by compilation errors on 'var'.
//   • Getter functions, while documented to be read-only, can modify state at runtime – this behavior is intentional but deviates from the documentation’s wording.
//   • Loop constructs (while and repeat) and conditionals compile and operate as expected.
//
// Next Steps:
// Future cycles will continue to explore additional language features, including deeper control-flow constructs, assembly functions, map operations, and potential corner cases not covered in this cycle.
