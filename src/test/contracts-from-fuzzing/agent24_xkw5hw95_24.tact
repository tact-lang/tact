// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Summary for Bounced Messages and Bounce Receivers in Tact Contracts

/*
FINAL SUMMARY:
--------------
Our deep and systematic fuzz-testing cycle focused on the bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts yields the following conclusions:

1. Documentation Consistency:
   • According to the official Tact documentation (see docs_book_bounced.md citeturn0file0 and docs_book_contracts.md citeturn0file9), a message sent with the bounce flag set to true will bounce back if it fails to be processed. To handle such messages, contracts must define a bounce receiver. The receiver can be declared in one of two valid ways:
       - A typed bounce receiver: e.g.,
             bounced(msg: bounced<T>) { … }
       - A raw bounce receiver: e.g.,
             bounced(rawMsg: Slice) { … }
   • The documentation mandates that a bounce receiver must declare exactly one parameter of the correct type, and any deviation (duplicate declarations, missing parameters, or invalid types) should be caught at compile time.

2. Fuzz-Testing Results:
   • Valid Definitions:
     - A contract with a typed bounce receiver (ValidBounceTyped) compiles successfully when declared as:
             bounced(msg: bounced<BounceMsg>) { … }
       This was further validated by testing with a simple message type (BounceMsg).
     - A contract using a raw bounce receiver (ValidBounceRaw) using:
             bounced(rawMsg: Slice) { … }
       compiles correctly.

   • Error Conditions:
     - Our tests confirmed that any attempt to define multiple bounce receivers in a single contract, or to supply an incorrect parameter (missing or of an invalid type), properly results in compile-time errors. This enforces the language rules as described in the documentation.

   • Multi-Contract (Chain) Bounce Scenario:
     - We simulated a multi-contract interaction where a CallerChain sends a message with bounce enabled to a ReceiverChain contract deliberately designed to fail (via require(false, ...)).
     - The CallerChain’s bounce receiver successfully captures the bounced message, as evidenced by a state update (chainBounced flag set to true). This confirms that bounced messages are properly propagated between contracts.

   • Additional Conventions:
     - The underscore naming convention for unused bounce receiver parameters (e.g., bounced(_msg: bounced<BounceMsg>)) is correctly accepted by the compiler.

3. Final Conclusion:
   • Throughout the testing cycle, all observed behaviors were completely consistent with the official Tact specifications. Valid bounce receiver implementations compile and operate correctly, while any erroneous definitions are reliably rejected with clear compiler errors. The multi-contract bounce mechanism also behaves as expected.

Result: No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were found. Bounce receiver functionality in Tact operates robustly and exactly as documented.
