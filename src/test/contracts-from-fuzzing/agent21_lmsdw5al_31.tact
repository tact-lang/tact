// Final Answer: Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Conclusion for initOf and Cross-Contract Relationships in Tact

/*
Overview:
---------
Our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle focused on verifying the initOf expression and its role in establishing cross-contract relationships in Tact. We crafted a variety of minimal test snippets to stress-test common and edge-case scenarios inspired by the official documentation (see docs_book_expressions.md citeturn0file3 and docs_ref_core-addresses.md citeturn0file0). The following scenarios were examined:

1. Simple Cross-Contract Initialization:
   • A parent contract invoked initOf on a basic child contract and computed its address using contractAddress. This validated the basic mechanism for generating a StateInit package and deriving a contract's address.

2. Multi-Level Parent-Child Relationships:
   • A hierarchy (GrandChild → Child → Parent) was set up where each level used initOf to initialize its immediate child and compute the address. This confirmed support for nested contract graphs.

3. Recursive Initialization:
   • A contract invoked initOf on itself within its receive() function to compute its own StateInit and address. This test demonstrated that self-referential initialization is permitted.

4. Mutual Recursive Initialization:
   • Two contracts mutually invoked initOf on each other, testing circular dependency resolution. Both contracts compiled successfully, showing that the compiler handles mutually recursive relationships correctly.

5. Deep Nested Contract Graph:
   • A complex nested graph with five contract levels (Level0 to Level4) was implemented, with each contract using initOf for its child. The entire structure compiled flawlessly, confirming robust handling of deep nesting.

6. Parameterized Contracts:
   • A contract with constructor parameters was instantiated using initOf (both from its own receiver and via an external call). This validated that initOf properly handles contracts with parameters.

Results & Conclusion:
-----------------------
Every test case compiled successfully without errors or warnings. The derived StateInit packages and computed contract addresses behaved exactly as predicted by the Tact documentation. 

Thus, our fuzz-testing cycle confirms that:
   - The Tact compiler correctly implements initOf in simple, nested, recursive, mutually recursive, and deep graph scenarios,
   - Cross-contract initialization and related functionalities (like contractAddress) operate in strict accordance with official documentation,
   - Parameterized contract instantiation using initOf also performs as expected.

No discrepancies, bugs, or unexpected behaviors were observed. The observed behaviors fully align with the documented specifications, validating the robustness of the Tact compiler's implementation of cross-contract relationships.
