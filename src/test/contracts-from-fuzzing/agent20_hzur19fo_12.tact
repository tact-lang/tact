// Final summary report for testing asm functions:
//
// 1. Documentation Retrieval:
//    The file search results returned comprehensive sections on asm functions covering argument/return arrangements,
//    TVM instructions usage, parameters (including struct flattening), extension (`extends`) functions with "self" parameter,
//    attributes (like mutates, inline), and limitations such as stack underflow, overflow, and issues with primitive usage without an consuming instruction.
//
// 2. Compilation Tests:
//    • A basic asm function (answer) using a PUSHINT instruction compiled and executed correctly.
//    • A simple identity function returning its parameter compiled properly, validating direct parameter usage.
//    • A test representing invalid use of a primitive (attempting to compile a standalone primitive) was correctly rejected (commented out in the tests).
//    • Flattening a struct parameter (AB) and correctly adding the fields worked as documented.
//    • A swap function (swapPair) using a return rearrangement (-> 1 0) to reorder the two returned values compiled correctly.
//    • Extension functions using the 'extends' attribute were validated after using the required first parameter naming convention (self), and these behaved as expected.
//    • Nested structure parameter flattening (NestedAB) was successfully compiled with the expected flattening order.
//    • Attributes such as mutates and inline were accepted and performed as expected.
//    • Assembly function with no explicit return type (noReturn) was accepted (valid behavior, as no return value is captured).
//
// 3. Observations & Conclusions:
//    All tests for asm functions behaved consistently with the documentation. The assembly functions correctly parsed and executed
//    TVM instructions, supported parameter flattening (including nested structures), and respected ordering and arrangement rules.
//    The extension function conventions, including the requirement that the first parameter must be named "self", were enforced.
//    Testing did not reveal any subtle compiler bugs or mismatches between the documented behavior and the implemented behavior.

// In conclusion, our comprehensive testing cycle for the asm functions feature did not uncover any unexpected behavior or discrepancies
// relative to the documentation (aside from issues already known and excluded from retesting). The Tact compiler's implementation of asm functions
// aligns with the official documentation as of our latest tests.

// End of report.
