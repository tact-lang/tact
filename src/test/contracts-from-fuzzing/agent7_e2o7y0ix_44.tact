      Summary of Comprehensive Fuzz Testing Cycle:

      Over an extended, rigorous series of tests, we have exercised and validated a broad range of Tact compiler features. Our systematic fuzz testing covered the following areas:

      1. Maps and Dictionaries:
         - Basic operations: Insertion, deletion, retrieval, and iteration (foreach) have been confirmed to work as documented. In particular, iteration over maps is allowed only on path expressions, as described in the official docs (see docs_book_maps.md citeturn0file0 and docs_book_statements.md citeturn0file1).
         - Advanced map functions such as .replace(), .replaceGet(), and .deepEquals() behave exactly as specified (refer to docs_book_maps.md citeturn0file8 and citeturn0file9).
         - Serialization constraints enforce that keys must use fixed-width formats; using variable-width (varint) for keys is correctly prohibited.
         - Nested maps are supported when the syntax is disambiguated by inserting a space between consecutive closing angle brackets (e.g. "map<Int, map<Int, Int> >").

      2. Bitwise Operators:
         - Standard bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, left/right shifts) on 257-bit signed integers yielded correct, expected outcomes (see docs_book_operators.md citeturn0file4).

      3. Structs and Messages:
         - Structs are correctly initialized, support nested compositions, and allow for destructuring (including field punning and discarding fields with underscores). These behaviors match the documented examples (refer to docs_book_statements.md citeturn0file1 and docs_book_maps.md citeturn0file9).

      4. Error Handling:
         - The try-catch mechanism reliably captures runtime errors, such as cell underflow (exit code 9), demonstrating robust error management.

      5. Contract State Modifications and Getter Behavior:
         - Non-getter functions persistently modify state variables, while getters—even if they perform runtime modifications—do not persist these changes after a TVM run. This behavior aligns with clarifications in the official documentation (see https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#getter-functions).

      6. Optionals and Null Handling:
         - Optional types function as expected: null comparisons, the use of the non-null assertion operator (!!), and helper functions (e.g. safeAdd) all yield the correct outcomes.

      7. Contract Message Receiver Behavior:
         - Contracts can define multiple receive handlers (both with specific tags and as a fallback), and these handlers compile correctly, ensuring proper message routing as per documentation.

      Conclusion:
      ------------
      Every feature we tested—from maps and bitwise operators to structs and error handling—operated exactly as specified in the official Tact documentation. The only subtle nuance detected was the syntactic requirement for an extra space in nested map generic type declarations, a known parser behavior rather than a bug.

      Overall status: All tested features conform to the official documentation. No significant compiler bugs or discrepancies were detected.

      Continuing systematic exploration, we now proceed to further compiler features with the same rigorous methodology.
