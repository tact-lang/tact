// Final summary of Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Testing

/*
Summary:

The following comprehensive suite of tests was designed to validate several aspects of bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact contracts. The tests cover:

1. Basic typed bounce receivers (BounceTest1) as described in the Tact documentation on bounced messages (see docs_book_bounced.md  ) and receiver functions (docs_book_contracts.md  ).

2. Bounce receivers using raw Slice types (BounceTest_RawSlice), which makes use of allowed Slice operations (asString) verified in docs_book_cells.md  .

3. A self-bouncing contract (BounceChain) that sends a bounceable message back to itself to test whether the bounced receiver correctly processes a bounced message and triggers a reply via self.reply, as illustrated in the official examples in docs_ref_core-send.md  .

4. A recursive/chain bounce scenario (BounceRecursive) where a bounceable message is sent to an external address and the bounced message is handled, demonstrating multi-level bounce flows.

5. A conflict scenario (BounceConflict) in which both a typed and a fallback (raw Slice) bounce receiver are declared, ensuring that the compiler resolves the ambiguity by selecting the more specific type, per Tact language design.

6. A state-modifying bounce receiver (BounceState) that updates persistent state and issues a reply. This test verifies that while getter functions cannot modify state, bounce receivers (which are runtime receivers) can modify state variables as confirmed by documentation clarifications (see docs_book_contracts.md  ).

All the tests compiled successfully and behaved as expected without any unexpected errors. There were no deviations or discrepancies between the observed compiler behavior and the documentation regarding bounced messages or bounce receivers.

Conclusion:

These extensive tests confirm that the Tact compiler's bounce receiver functionality adheres to the documented behavior, including correct processing of both typed and raw bounce messages, resolution of receiver conflicts, and allowance for state modifications at runtime. No severe issues or documentation mismatches were detected.
