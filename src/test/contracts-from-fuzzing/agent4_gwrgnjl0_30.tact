/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
This fuzz-testing cycle focused on a systematic examination of the Tact maps implementation, emphasizing key and value type constraints, serialization behavior, and operations including insertion, deletion, querying, iteration, and equality comparisons. Our objective was to rigorously validate every significant claim and edge case described in the Tact documentation for maps (please refer to sections such as the allowed types and serialization details in docs_book_maps.md  ,  , and iteration examples in docs_book_statements.md  ).

Test Summary:
-------------
1. Allowed Key Types:
   - Valid maps using Int and Address as keys were compiled and functioned correctly (e.g.,
     TestMapValid and TestAddressKey).
   - Attempts to instantiate maps with invalid keys (e.g., String or Struct types) yield compile-time errors, thereby enforcing the documented constraints (as seen in our TestInvalidKey and TestStructKey tests).

2. Allowed Value Types and Serialization:
   - Maps with allowed value types (such as Int, Bool, and serialized variants like Int as uint8) compiled successfully and returned expected values (e.g., TestSerializedMap, TestMapBoolFixed).
   - The serialization behavior confirms that only Int keys and values support serialization, matching the documentation which states that other key types (or value types beyond Int) do not support custom serialization formats.

3. Core Map Operations:
   - Operations such as setting (.set), querying (.get and .exists), replacing (.replace and .replaceGet), and deletion (.del or setting a key to null) have been thoroughly validated. For instance, TestMapOps and TestMapSummary confirm that:
     • Insertion correctly places key-value pairs.
     • Query operations return accurate results.
     • Replacement operations yield the proper boolean response or old value.
     • Deletion operations effectively remove entries.

4. Nested Maps and Iteration Restrictions:
   - The tests involving nested maps (using a helper struct like AllowanceMap to encapsulate an inner map) confirm that nested maps work correctly when accessed via valid path expressions (e.g., self.data). As documented, iteration over maps from non-path expressions (like function returns) is disallowed and yields compile-time errors. These limitations were validated in our nested maps and iteration tests.

5. Equality Comparisons:
   - The difference between shallow equality (using the ‘==’ operator, which relies on comparing underlying cell hashes) and deep equality (.deepEquals, which performs an entry-by-entry comparison) was systematically verified (see TestMapDeepEquals). Alterations, such as replacing a value, were correctly reflected in both comparisons.

6. Edge Cases: Complex and Unusual Scenarios:
   - We pushed the boundaries with tests using Boolean values as map entries and nested complex data types, ensuring that even in edge cases the compiler behavior is consistent with the official documentation. Subtle cases requiring explicit path expressions for iteration and proper syntactic forms for conditional checks were extensively tested.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our exhaustive fuzz-testing cycle indicates that the Tact compiler adheres strictly to the official specification for maps. Specifically:
   - Key type restrictions (only Int and Address allowed) are enforced as documented.
   - Supported value types and serialization options function accurately.
   - Core operations (insertion, deletion, replacement, querying) perform as expected, with additional safeguards for iteration over nested maps.
   - The differentiation between shallow and deep equality is maintained.

No discrepancies between documented behavior and the actual behavior of the Tact compiler were found during this cycle. All tests, including complex edge cases, were successful and affirm that the maps implementation in Tact is robust and reliable.
