/*
Final Comprehensive Summary for Map Fuzz-Testing:

Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle for Tact maps has rigorously validated the following:

1. Allowed Key/Value Types & Serialization:
   - Only Int and Address are permitted as map keys, while values can also be Bool, Cell, Struct, or Message. Attempts to use disallowed key types (e.g. String or a custom struct) yield the expected compiler errors (see docs_book_maps.md  ).
   - Serialization modifiers (like "as uint8") on keys of type Int work correctly, conserving storage space as documented.

2. Insertion, Retrieval, Replacement, & Deletion:
   - Inserting and retrieving entries operates as expected. Both replace() and replaceGet() methods successfully update or delete values, returning appropriate old values or null when the key does not exist.
   - Deleting an entry by setting its value to null (or directly via del()) behaves consistently with documentation.

3. Equality Comparisons:
   - The deepEquals() method reliably returns true for maps with identical entries regardless of insertion order, while the shallow equality operator (==) may return false when underlying serialization or cell hash orders differ (in accordance with the docs).

4. Iteration & Modification Edge Cases:
   - Iteration is only permitted over path expressions, enforcing a known constraint. Attempts to iterate over temporary or non-identifier maps generate compiler errors as expected.
   - Modifications during iteration (such as deleting keys) compile and are processed according to the expected behavior, though such operations need careful runtime consideration.

5. Additional Edge Cases:
   - Arithmetic expressions can be used as keys (with proper integer division, sign handling, etc.) and were processed correctly.
   - Nested maps, where maps are embedded in structs and used as map values, perform as documented, returning expected nested values.

Throughout our extensive tests (including tests for shallow equality, deep equality, replace, replace deletion, arithmetic-based keys, and nested maps) every observed behavior has matched the documented language specifications (see docs_book_maps.md   and related sections).

Conclusion:
No significant compiler bugs or documentation mismatches were discovered during our rigorous fuzz-testing of maps. The Tact compiler’s implementation of maps—including type restrictions, serialization, equality methods, and iteration rules—aligns with its official documentation. 

We continue our systematic fuzz-testing cycle by moving on to further compiler features with the same level of in-depth scrutiny.
