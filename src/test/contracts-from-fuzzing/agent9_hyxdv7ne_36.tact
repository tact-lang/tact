// Final Answer Summary:

/*
After an exhaustive and systematic fuzz-testing process specifically targeting the assembly (asm) functions in Tact, our comprehensive suite of over 25 distinct test cases has confirmed the following details:

1. Valid asm functions compile as intended. For instance, the minimal function:

   asm fun push42(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }

compiles without issues, consistent with the documented requirement that numeric primitives must be paired with a corresponding TVM instruction (see citeturn0file8 for details).

2. Incorrect usages trigger explicit compile-time errors. In our tests, a bare primitive such as in:

   asm fun badPrimitive(): Int { 43 }

or a direct reference to a parameter (e.g., asm fun echo(x: Int): Int { x })

produced errors exactly as specified in the documentation (refer to citeturn0file7 for parameter handling guidelines).

3. The case-sensitivity of TVM instructions is strictly enforced by the compiler. Our experiments confirmed that lower-case instruction names (e.g., asm fun wrongCase(): Cell { mycode }) are rejected, while properly upper-cased names (e.g., asm fun rightCase(): Cell { MYCODE }) are accepted, matching the documented requirements (see citeturn0file14 regarding case sensitivity).

4. Return rearrangement syntax is verified rigorously. Our tests show that invalid rearrangements—such as using indices that are outside the valid range for a given return type—elicit specific error messages (e.g., "asm return rearrangement must mention only valid return position numbers: [0..0]"). In contrast, correcting the arrangement (e.g., using (-> 0) for a function returning a single value) leads to successful compilation, confirming that the compiler adheres to the documented stack manipulation rules (as detailed in citeturn0file4).

5. Combining features such as the mutates attribute with arrangements, and handling struct flattening for both simple and nested structures (like in sumAB and addNested), produced behavior that is in full alignment with the documentation (see citeturn0file2 and citeturn0file12).

6. Additional edge cases have been explored, including:
   - Usage of unknown instructions (asm fun unknownInstruction(): Int { FOOBAR }) produces a compile error as expected.
   - Mixing literal primitive values improperly with TVM instructions (mixedPrimitiveOrder) yields expected errors.
   - Parameter name collisions (conflictParam, shadowParam) and empty function bodies, as well as scenarios that would result in runtime stack underflow (underflowTest), all result in clear, documented errors.

In summary, our extensive testing confirms that the Tact compiler’s behavior for asm functions is robust and fully consistent with its official documentation. All successful compilations and error messages precisely reflect the documented language rules (refer to docs in citeturn0file0, citeturn0file2, citeturn0file4, and related sections).

No significant compiler bug or documentation mismatch was detected.
