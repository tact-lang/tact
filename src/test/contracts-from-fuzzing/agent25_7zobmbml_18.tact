// Comprehensive Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Testing Summary

/*
Summary:
---------
Our fuzz-testing cycle focused on thoroughly examining bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact contracts. We explored a range of scenarios that include:

1. Standard typed bounce receivers that use the parameter type bounced<MyMessage> (as illustrated in BounceTest1), which verifies that the compiler correctly dispatches bounced messages per documentation (see docs_book_bounced.md   and docs_book_contracts.md  ).

2. Bounce receivers using a raw Slice parameter (BounceTest_RawSlice) which converts the Slice to a String (using the asString() function defined in docs_book_cells.md  ), confirming that generic bounce handling operates as allowed.

3. Self-bouncing scenarios (BounceChain) where a bounceable message is sent to the contract’s own address (using myAddress() from docs_ref_core-contextstate.md  ). The bounced receiver, typed as bounced<MyMessage>, triggers a self.reply, matching the examples provided in the Tact documentation.

4. Multi-level/recursive bouncing (BounceRecursive) in which an outbound bounceable message sent to an external address eventually bounces, and the raw Slice bounce receiver processes it to reply with an appropriate message.

5. Receiver conflict resolution (BounceConflict) where both a typed bounce receiver and a fallback raw Slice receiver are declared. The compiler correctly resolves the ambiguity in favor of the typed receiver when applicable, which aligns with the language’s design principles.

6. State modification within bounced receivers (BounceState). In this test, the contract updates a persistent counter when a bounce occurs and also performs a self.reply. This confirms that while documentation notes that getter functions cannot modify state, bounce receivers (as runtime functions) are allowed to perform such modifications.

All test contracts compiled successfully and behaved as expected, with no discrepancies observed between the documented behavior and compiler output.

Conclusion:
------------
Based on this extensive and systematic exploration, our fuzz-testing confirms that the implementation of bounced messages and bounce receivers in the Tact compiler adheres to the official documentation. Standard bounce channels, multi-level bouncing, receiver conflict resolution, and state modifications in bounce handlers are all functioning as intended. No deviations, internal compiler errors, or mismatches with the published documentation were found.
