// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Summary Report

// In this fuzz-testing cycle, we selected an arbitrary section of the Tact documentation and methodically validated several features and documented claims. Our testing covered the following:

// 1. Variable Declarations:
//    - We attempted to declare a variable with the keyword 'var', which promptly resulted in a compilation error. This confirms that Tact enforces the use of 'let' for variable declarations, as shown in the examples in the documentation (see docs_book_statements.md  ).

// 2. Getter Functions and State Modifications:
//    - Per the official documentation (docs_book_contracts.md  ), getter functions are not supposed to modify the contract’s state. However, our test contract (ModifyGetter) deliberately modified a state variable within a getter. The fact that the code compiled successfully confirms a known discrepancy: getter functions may perform state modifications at runtime, although these changes do not persist after the TVM execution.

// 3. Control Flow Constructs and Loop Constructs:
//    - We validated basic conditional constructs (if/else) with a simple function that returns differing outputs based on a condition. The code assembled and compiled as per the documentation examples (see docs_book_statements.md  ).
//    - The while loop test was implemented in the WhileTest contract, where a state variable was incremented until it met a given condition. The loop executed as expected.
//    - The repeat loop was tested using a negative count (repeat(-1)), and as documented, the loop body was skipped. This conforms with the stated behavior in the docs (see docs_book_statements.md  ).

// Conclusion:
//    • Tact enforces variable declarations with 'let'—attempts to use 'var' are rejected.
//    • Getter functions, contrary to the documentation assertion of being read-only, can modify state variables at runtime. This is a known and previously documented discrepancy (see also docs_book_contracts.md  ).
//    • Loop constructs (while loops and repeat loops) and conditional statements behave exactly as described in Tact's documentation.

// No new severe bugs or discrepancies were uncovered in this testing cycle. The only notable nuance is the behavior of getter functions, which aligns with the actual compiler behavior observed in prior tests.

// Next steps will involve deeper exploration into additional features such as assembly functions, map operations, and further control-flow nuances to continue validating the consistency between Tact documentation and compiler behavior.

fun main(): Int {
    // Entry point; returns 0 as this is a dummy function to complete our test cycles
    return 0;
}
