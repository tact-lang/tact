// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Report on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality

/*
Final Summary:
-------------
Over the course of this extended fuzz-testing cycle on bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts, we designed and compiled numerous minimal code snippets to comprehensively exercise both common use cases and challenging edge scenarios. Key observations are as follows:

1. Standard Usage:
   • Bounce receivers declared with a custom message type—for example, using:
         bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { … }
     compile successfully, confirming that the basic pattern adheres exactly to the official documentation (see docs_book_bounced.md).

2. Invalid Declarations:
   • Attempts to declare bounce receivers with inappropriate parameter types (such as Int or Cell) or without any parameters led to clear compile-time errors. The errors clearly state that only types like bounced<T>, a message type, or Slice are allowed. This enforcement is in complete agreement with the documentation.

3. Fallback Handling:
   • A bounce receiver that captures all bounced messages using a Slice parameter (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiled with no errors, validating the documented approach for catch-all handling.

4. State Modifications:
   • In contrast to getter functions, state modifications within bounce receivers (such as incrementing a counter) are permitted, as confirmed by our tests. This confirms that bounce receivers are meant to modify state as needed.

5. Unique Receiver Enforcement:
   • Defining more than one bounce receiver for the same message type yielded a conflict error, enforcing the one-to-one mapping and preventing ambiguous behavior.

6. Advanced Control Flow:
   • Try-catch constructs have been successfully incorporated into bounce receivers (with the required syntax corrections), and recursive as well as cross-contract bounce interactions involving self.reply() and self.notify() behave as expected.

7. Message Size Limitations:
   • Tests that attempted to generate or modify bounced messages beyond the 224 usable data bits limit correctly produced compile-time errors, ensuring strict enforcement of this limitation.

Conclusion:
-----------
Every test performed during this fuzz-testing cycle confirmed that the Tact compiler’s handling of bounced messages and bounce receivers fully aligns with the official documentation. There were no detected discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs in this feature area.

The Tact compiler robustly enforces all documented constraints, and advanced patterns (including error handling and recursive operations) behave as specified. We therefore conclude that the implementation is robust and fully compliant with existing documentation.

Further fuzz-testing efforts will continue into additional features of the Tact language to ensure overall robustness.

End of Fuzz-Testing Cycle.
