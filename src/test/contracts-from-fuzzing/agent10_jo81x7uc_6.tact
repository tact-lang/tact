/*
 Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing for initOf and cross-contract relationships.

 The following tests evaluate various scenarios involving initOf:

 1. Simple Cross-Contract Initialization:
    - Contract B calls initOf A() within a function, verifying that the initial state is computed correctly.

 2. Multi-Level / Hierarchical Initialization:
    - Contract C calls initOf A() and initOf B(), where B itself uses initOf A() in its init. This tests multi-level dependency.

 3. Circular Dependency between Contracts:
    - Contracts A and B mutually call initOf of each other in their init functions. The test contract (Tester) calls both initOf A() and initOf B() to ensure compilation succeeds in circular configurations.

 4. Self-Recursive Initialization:
    - Contract SelfRec calls initOf SelfRec() within its own init. This examines potential pitfalls of self-recursion in state initialization.

 All tests compile successfully (with expected error in one non-related method call that was corrected). These tests confirm that the Tact compiler accepts various valid and intricate usages of initOf, including cross-contract and recursive references, in accordance with the official documentation at:
     and  .

 Note: A prior snippet in Test 3 attempted to call a non-existent method on Cell (len()), which produced an error. That behavior is as expected since Cell type does not support a len() method. After revising that snippet, circular dependencies compiled without issue.

 Conclusion: The documented behavior for initOf to generate state initialization packages for contracts (even across circular or self-referential configurations) is in alignment with the compiler's behavior. No discrepancies or bugs have been observed under these tests.
