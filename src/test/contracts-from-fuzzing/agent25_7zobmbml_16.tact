// Final Report: Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Testing Cycle

/*
Report Summary:
-----------------
Over the course of our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle for bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact contracts, we have validated numerous aspects of bounced message handling. Our tests covered:

1. Standard Typed Bounce Receivers:
   - Using a parameter of type bounced<MyMessage> (see contract BounceTest1).
   - The compiler dispatches bounced messages to these functions as documented (see docs_book_bounced.md & docs_book_contracts.md).

2. Raw Slice Bounce Receivers:
   - Declaring the bounced receiver with a raw Slice parameter, and converting that Slice to a String with asString(), as allowed by the Slice documentation (docs_book_cells.md).

3. Self-Bouncing Messages (BounceChain):
   - A contract sends a bounceable message to itself (using myAddress() from docs_ref_core-contextstate.md), with the bounced receiver calling self.reply to confirm bounce receipt. This behavior matches documented examples in docs_ref_core-send.md.

4. Recursive (or chained) Bouncing (BounceRecursive):
   - Demonstrates sending a bounceable message to an external address that eventually bounces back, triggering a raw Slice bounce handler and then a reply via self.reply.

5. Receiver Conflict Resolution (BounceConflict):
   - A contract that declares both a typed bounce receiver and a fallback raw Slice receiver. The compiler correctly prefers the more specific type (typed) over the generic one.

6. State Modifications in Bounce Receivers (BounceState):
   - Tests that within a bounced receiver, persistent state (a counter) can be updated and a reply can be issued. This confirms that although getters cannot modify state, bounce receivers (runtime functions) can, aligning with documentation clarifications.

Findings:
------------
- All test contracts compiled successfully and behaved as expected. Every test verified its targeted functionality without unexpected errors.
- No discrepancies or deviations from the documented behavior were detected. The compiler's handling of bounce messages—whether typed or raw—is robust and mirrors the official specification.

Conclusion:
------------
Our extensive fuzz-testing confirms that the bounced message and bounce receiver functionality in Tact adheres to the documented behavior. The compiler correctly supports both specific and fallback bounce handlers, resolves overloads properly, handles recursion in bouncing, and permits allowed state modifications within bounce receivers.

Based on these tests, we did not observe any significant issues or mismatches between the documented and actual behavior of the Tact compiler regarding bounced messages.
