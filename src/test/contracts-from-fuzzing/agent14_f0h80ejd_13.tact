// Final summary of our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle for contract addresses in Tact

/*
    In this extensive fuzz-testing cycle, we systematically explored the following aspects of contract addresses:

    1. Address creation via newAddress() for valid workchain IDs (0, -1) with typical and boundary hash values.
    2. Verification that invalid workchain IDs (such as 1) produce compile-time errors (as documented in docs_ref_core-addresses.md).
    3. Conversion from Address to Slice and back using asSlice() and asAddressUnsafe(), confirming proper roundtrip behavior.
    4. Consistent behavior of the toString() method, returning a non-empty and meaningful string representation of an Address.
    5. Equality and inequality tests, including tests contrasting addresses constructed with the same hash but different chain IDs (e.g. 0 vs -1) and with different hash values.
    6. Address usage in state storage, map operations, and subsequent updates to ensure that addresses behave consistently when stored and compared.

    Each test case was designed to represent subtle and tricky edge cases in contract addresses, including roundtrip conversions and variations in chain id assignments.

    All results were in full agreement with the official documentation (e.g., docs_ref_core-addresses.md and docs_book_contracts.md) with no observed discrepancies or unexpected behaviors.

    No bugs or mismatches were identified during our thorough and relentless fuzz-testing cycle.

    We will continue our exploration as part of our ongoing fuzzing process, but the present round of tests confirms that the contract address functionality behaves as documented and expected.
