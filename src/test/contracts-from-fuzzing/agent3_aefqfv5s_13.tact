/* Summary: Comprehensive Testing Cycle for ASM Functions

Overview:
This test suite extensively explored the asm functions feature in Tact, thoroughly validating the official documentation by exercising edge cases and verifying both allowed and disallowed behaviors. The tests included:

1. A simple asm function that uses the PUSHINT instruction, validating that literal primitives can be pushed onto the stack.

2. Using a struct parameter (Pair) that is flattened, where the two integer fields are passed and then added via the ADD instruction.

3. A function (bad) that improperly provides an isolated primitive literal with no consuming TVM instruction, which correctly resulted in a compilation error.

4. An asm function (identity) that attempts to reference a parameter name directly in its body. The error message confirmed that the parameter is interpreted as a TVM instruction, leading to a compilation error as documented.

5. A function (swapPair) that uses return arrangement to swap the order of return values. Compilation was successful, verifying that arranged return values are handled correctly.

6. A function (swapArgOrder) that combines argument and return arrangements, thereby checking correct reordering of input parameters and output capture on the stack. Compilation succeeded as expected.

7. A function (depthFunc) making use of the DEPTH TVM instruction, confirming that such introspection instructions work as intended.

8. An asm function defined within a contract (insideContract) which correctly resulted in a compilation error, in line with the documentation that asm functions must be defined at the module level.

9. An asm function with both 'extends' and 'mutates' attributes (modFun), confirming that these attributes are accepted together when used correctly.

10. A test (wrongArrang) demonstrating an incorrect argument arrangement which did not properly list all function parameters; this produced a compilation error.

11. A test attempting to use a Tact statement (let declaration) inside an asm function (localVarTest), which caused the expected compilation error as asm functions are only permitted to include TVM instructions and primitives.

12. A nested struct flattening test (mulOfSums) that validated that nested structures are flattened in a right-to-left manner as documented, compiling successfully.

Conclusion:
All results confirmed the official Tact documentation regarding asm functions. The assembled tests verify that the compiler accepts permitted constructs and correctly rejects disallowed ones, with behavior closely aligned with documentation. No unexpected behavior, errors, or discrepancies were identified beyond the known issues.

This completes the comprehensive exploration of the asm functions feature.
