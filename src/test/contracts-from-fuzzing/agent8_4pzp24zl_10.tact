// Final Summary: Exhaustive Testing of asm Functions

/*
This comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle focused on the asm functions feature in Tact. We systematically exercised various aspects outlined in the official documentation (see  ,  , and  ) through a series of minimal code snippets.

Key areas explored included:
  1. Basic Functionality: Verifying that a simple asm function (e.g., returning 42 using '42 INT') compiles correctly.
  2. Parameter and Instruction Handling: Confirming that the misuse of parameter names (e.g., using 'x' as an instruction) and unconsumed primitives leads to appropriate errors.
  3. Arrangement Declarations: Testing valid parameter arrangements and valid return arrangements for functions, including swapping parameters and struct field reordering (e.g., asm functions with arrangements such as 'asm(a b) fun reverseAdd(a: Int, b: Int): Int { SWAP ADD }' and struct-return functions using 'asm(-> 1 0)').
  4. Whitespace, Comments, and Formatting: Demonstrating that extra whitespace, newlines, and inline comments in asm function bodies do not interfere with proper parsing or compilation.
  5. Compiler Enforcement of Constraints: Confirming that errors such as invalid return arrangement indices (e.g., specifying positions outside the allowed range) are correctly rejected, as mandated by the documentation.
  6. Edge-Case Operations: Exploring scenarios likely to introduce runtime issues, such as stack underflow with operations like SWAP on an insufficient stack, and multiple constant pushes.

Throughout the testing, every observed behavior was consistent with the official Tact language documentation (detailed in sources  ,  , and  , among others). No significant compiler bugs or documented mismatches have been identified based on our persistent and meticulous exploration of the asm functions feature.

This testing process will continue as we explore additional language features, ensuring rigorous verification of the compiler's adherence to its specifications.
