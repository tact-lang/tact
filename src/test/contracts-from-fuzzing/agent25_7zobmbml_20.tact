Final Answer:
---------------
Our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle on bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact has validated that the compiler behaves exactly as documented. We extensively tested a variety of scenarios:

• A minimal typed bounce receiver (using a parameter of type bounced<MyMessage>) compiles and is dispatched properly, as described by the official documentation (see docs_book_bounced.md).

• Bounce receivers implemented using a raw Slice parameter work correctly, permitting allowed operations (such as converting the Slice to a String with asString()), in line with the behavior specified in the documentation for Slice operations (see docs_book_cells.md).

• In a self-bouncing scenario, a contract sends a bounceable message to itself (using myAddress()), and the corresponding bounced receiver triggers a self.reply, matching the documented examples on outbound messaging (e.g., in docs_ref_core-send.md).

• More complex, recursive bouncing scenarios are handled gracefully. Even when a bounceable message is sent to an external address and then bounces, the raw Slice bounce receiver processes the bounce and successfully triggers further actions.

• When both a typed bounce receiver and a fallback raw Slice bounce receiver are declared in the same contract, the compiler resolves this by favoring the more specific (typed) receiver, which is consistent with Tact’s design.

• Finally, testing state modifications within bounce receivers (e.g., incrementing a persistent counter) produced the expected behavior, confirming that runtime bounce handlers may modify state—although getters are restricted from doing so—further aligning with the documentation.

All of our test contracts compiled and behaved as expected, and no discrepancies, bugs, or mismatches between the documented behavior and the actual compiler output were observed.

Conclusion: The Tact compiler’s handling of bounce messages and bounce receivers is robust and aligned with the official documentation. Our extensive tests confirm that both standard and edge-case behaviors are correctly implemented.
