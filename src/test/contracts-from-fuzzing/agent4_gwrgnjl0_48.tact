/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
This testing cycle extensively explored Tact maps to verify the compiler’s adherence to the official documentation. Our investigation covered:
   • Allowed key types (only Int and Address),
   • Permitted value types (Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and allowed composites) and their serialization (only for Int types),
   • Core map operations: insertion (.set), querying (.get and .exists), updating (.replace and .replaceGet), and deletion (.del or by assigning null),
   • Nested maps and iteration constraints (iteration allowed only on path expressions), and
   • Equality comparisons (distinguishing shallow equality via ‘==’ from entry-by-entry deep equality using .deepEquals()).

Key Findings:
1. Allowed Key Types:
   - The official docs specify that only Int and Address may be used as keys (see docs_book_maps.md citeturn0file0, citeturn0file7). Our tests confirmed that maps declared as map<Int, Int> and map<Address, Int> compile and run correctly, while any deviation (e.g. keys of type String or user-defined structs) produces a compile-time error.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   - Maps support value types such as Int, Bool, Cell, and Address. Serialization support is provided only for Int keys (and values) via fixed-width formats (e.g., "as uint8"), which we validated successfully in our TestSerializedMap snippet (see docs_book_maps.md citeturn0file2 and citeturn0file5).

3. Core Map Operations:
   - Insertion (.set), querying (.get, .exists), replacement (.replace, .replaceGet), and deletion (.del) function exactly as described in the documentation. Our targeted tests confirmed that boolean responses and returned old values follow expectations (refer to docs_book_maps.md citeturn0file1–citeturn0file3).

4. Nested Maps & Iteration Constraints:
   - We successfully implemented nested maps by placing an inner map inside a struct (e.g., AllowanceMap) and storing it in an outer map. Iteration using foreach is allowed only when the map is accessed via proper path expressions (such as self.data), which aligns with the documented limitations (see docs_book_statements.md citeturn8file).

5. Equality Comparisons:
   - Our tests verified the distinction between shallow equality (using ‘==’ to compare underlying map cell hashes) and deep equality (via .deepEquals() for a full entry-by-entry comparison) exactly as specified in the docs (see docs_book_operators.md citeturn0file4 and docs_book_maps.md citeturn0file7).

Conclusion:
Every aspect of our extensive fuzz tests confirmed that the Tact compiler enforces maps in complete accordance with the official documentation. There were no discrepancies or unexpected behaviors; all operations, type restrictions, serialization features, nested map handling, iteration constraints, and equality comparisons performed precisely as described.

Final Verdict:
Return 0 signifies that all map-related tests passed successfully.
