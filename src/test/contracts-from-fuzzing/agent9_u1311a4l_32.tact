// Final Answer: Summary of Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle for Bounced Messages and Bounce Receivers

/*
After an extensive fuzz-testing cycle specifically targeting bounced messages and the bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts, we have compiled and evaluated a broad range of scenarios. Our tests covered:

1. Standard Usage: 
   • Bounce receivers declared with custom message types (e.g., bounced<MyMessage>) compile as expected, which validates the basic and recommended usage according to the documentation.

2. Invalid Receiver Definitions:
   • Bounce receiver declarations using invalid parameter types (like Int or Cell) or omitting parameters altogether reliably produced compile-time errors. The compiler’s error messages explicitly state that only bounced<T>, message types, or Slice are allowed as parameter types.

3. Fallback Receiver Behavior: 
   • Bounce receivers accepting a raw Slice (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiled without error. This fallback mechanism allows contracts to capture all bounced messages, exactly as described in the official docs.

4. State Modification Capabilities: 
   • We demonstrated that bounce receivers are allowed to perform state modifications (such as incrementing a counter), providing a vital distinction from getters, which are restricted from such changes.

5. Multiple Receiver Conflict Prevention:
   • Attempts to declare more than one bounce receiver for the same message type appropriately triggered conflict errors, enforcing a one-to-one mapping between message types and their bounce receiver.

6. Advanced Control Flow and Error Handling:
   • Incorporation of try-catch blocks within bounce receivers (with the proper syntax) compiled successfully, confirming that robust error handling is supported. Recursive and cross-contract bounce handling patterns (using self.reply() and self.notify()) also behaved as documented.

7. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
   • Finally, tests that attempted to modify a bounced message beyond the 224 usable data bits limit correctly resulted in compile-time errors, aligning with the network and documentation constraints.

Conclusion:
----------
Across all tested scenarios—including ordinary cases, edge cases, and intentional misuse—the Tact compiler’s behavior completely conforms to the official documentation on bounced messages and bounce receivers. The behavior is robust, predictable, and well-enforced through compile-time checks. No discrepancies or unidentified bugs were observed during this cycle.

This cycle confirms that the handling of bounced messages in Tact is robust and implemented as specified, and further fuzz-testing efforts will continue to push the boundaries of other language features.

End of Fuzz-Testing Cycle.
