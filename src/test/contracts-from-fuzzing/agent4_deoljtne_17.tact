// Final summary of extended ASM function fuzz tests in Tact

// Our extended fuzz cycle for ASM functions in Tact has been conducted thoroughly as follows:

// 1. We verified the correct handling of minimal asm functions returning constants, as in:
asm fun answer(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }
// which works as expected, matching the documentation ( ).

// 2. We tested basic arithmetic operations in asm functions (e.g., add(x, y) through ADD, swap and ADD sequences), confirming proper stack behavior.

// 3. We confirmed that using struct parameters and nested structs (e.g., in sum and mulOfSums) are correctly flattened and captured, as documented in the sections on parameter calling conventions ( ).

// 4. We submitted tests with expected errors: literal values without following consuming instructions (e.g., asm fun bad(): Int { 43 } and extraLiteralError), mismatched argument arrangements (asm(x -> 0) fun wrongArrangement2(x: Int, y: Int): Int { ADD }), and invalid calls inside asm functions (attempts to call non-asm functions) producing predictable failures.

// 5. We exercised edge cases such as using inline comments in various positions, negative and large literal pushes, unknown TVM instructions, and complex multi-instruction sequences, all of which validated the compiler’s adherence to the documented TVM assembly semantics (see citeturn0file2 and citeturn0file5 for TVM instructions and arrangements).

// 6. Additionally, tests with attributes like 'mutates' and 'extends' were carefully corrected (ensuring the first parameter is 'self') and compiled successfully, confirming guidance in the documentation regarding ASM function attributes (citeturn0file6).

// 7. Throughout the testing cycle, each test case behaved exactly as per the Tact documentation. All compilation errors were issued when expected and all valid snippets compiled properly and are in line with the specifications.

// Conclusion: Our comprehensive fuzzing cycle for asm functions did not reveal any deviations from the official Tact documentation. The compiler’s behavior is consistent with the documented behavior regarding stack ordering, inline comments, arrangements, and error handling in asm functions.

// Continuing our rigorous exploration, we now prepare to extend similar exhaustive testing to the next feature category onward from ASM functions unless further instructions are provided.
