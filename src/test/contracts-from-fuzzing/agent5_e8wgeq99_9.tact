// Comprehensive Initial Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report
//
// We began by exploring a section of the Tact documentation related to function definitions, block statements, and local variable (let) declarations.
// The following points summarize the key findings and validations:
//
// 1. Basic Function Definitions:
//    • The simple arithmetic function 'add' compiled successfully, in full accordance with documentation. This confirms that the Tact compiler correctly accepts standard function definitions and return expressions.
//
// 2. Local Variable Declarations (let):
//    • Attempting to declare a local variable without an initializer (as in the 'missingInitializer' snippet) produced a compilation error. This reinforces the requirement that every 'let' declaration must include an initial value, as per the documentation.
//
// 3. Block Statements:
//    • A block used as a group of statements (in 'blockTest') compiled correctly when used as a side-effect grouping construct. However, when a block is attempted to be used directly as a return expression, it produces a syntax error. This behavior aligns with the expected language semantics for block statements.
//
// 4. Wildcard Variable Naming ('_'):
//    • The test for accessing a wildcard ('_') demonstrated that such variables cannot be accessed after declaration. In the 'underscoreTest' snippet, attempting to return '_' correctly results in a compilation error. This matches the documented restrictions regarding wildcard usage.
//
// 5. Let with Implicit and Explicit Types:
//    • The 'letTest' snippet confirms that both type inference and explicit type declarations function as expected when an initializer is provided.
//
// In summary, our initial cycle of fuzz-testing these core Tact features confirms that the Tact compiler adheres to the documented language rules regarding:
//    - Function definitions and arithmetic expressions
//    - Mandatory initialization for 'let' statements
//    - Allowed use of code blocks for grouping side effects (but not as direct return expressions)
//    - Wildcard variable usage and access restrictions
//
// No discrepancies, unexpected errors, or mismatches between the observed behavior and the documentation were detected in this cycle.
//
// Next Steps:
// We plan to extend our testing to other areas of the language, such as composite types, operators, getter functions, and additional edge cases, to further explore the robustness and compliance of the Tact compiler with its official documentation.

// --- Code Snippets ---

// 1. Basic function definition and arithmetic operation
fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b;
}

// 2. Block statement usage within a function
fun blockTest(): Int {
    {
        let x = 10;
        dump(x);
    }
    return 20;
}

// 3. Wildcard variable access: underscore cannot be accessed
fun underscoreTest(): Int {
    let _ = 42;
    // The following access would produce a compilation error as expected:
    // return _;
    return 0;
}

// 4. Proper let declarations with type inference and explicit type
fun letTest(): Int {
    let vInferred = 10;
    let vExplicit: Int = 20;
    return vInferred + vExplicit;
}
