// Final Report: Comprehensive Testing Cycle on asm functions
//
// We conducted an extensive series of tests on assembly (asm) functions in Tact, exploring the full range of documented features and edge cases.
// Our approach included:
//
// 1. Validation of basic functionality such as converting constants with PUSHINT (as seen in asm fun answer(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }),
//    confirming that the TVM instructions are executed as expected (see   and  ).
//
// 2. Error detection when only primitives are provided without a consuming instruction (asm fun bad(): Int { 43 }), which produced a compilation error, confirming that each primitive correctly must be paired with a TVM instruction.
//
// 3. Functionality of arithmetic in asm functions (asm fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int { ADD }), ensuring arithmetic operations work, as described in the TVM instructions documentation (refer to  ).
//
// 4. Testing argument arrangements including swapping parameters using 'asm(a b -> 1 0)', and verification of struct flattening for nested parameters (referenced in   and  ), both of which performed as documented.
//
// 5. Handling of parameter names conflicting with TVM instructions (e.g., naming a parameter DROP) showed that, as expected, the body does not access parameters directly but rather interprets tokens as TVM instructions.
//
// 6. The correct opcode variation for large integer constants was confirmed with the snippet using 999 PUSHINT.
//
// 7. Behavior with an asm function declared with an empty body while a return type exists (asm fun identityEmpty(x: Int): Int { }) compiled, which aligns with expected behavior even if runtime might result in a stack underflow if called.
//
// 8. Attribute ordering was also tested: while 'inline asm fun inlineTest(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }' failed due to order, reordering as 'asm inline fun inlineTest(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }' compiled successfully. This confirms the correct parsing order, as described in the official docs.
//
// All of these results are consistent with the official Tact assembly functions documentation (reviewed in   â€“  ). We detected no discrepancies between documented behavior and the actual compiler output in all our tests.
//
// Conclusion: The asm functions feature behaves as documented. We found no evidence of compiler bugs or incorrect behavior in our comprehensive and persistent testing cycle on asm functions.
