/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
Throughout our extensive fuzz-testing cycle, we focused on the behavior of maps (dictionaries) in Tact, with special emphasis on:

1. Allowed Key Types:
   • As documented in the Tact maps documentation (e.g., see  ), only Int and Address types are permitted as keys. Our tests using maps declared as map<Int, Int> and map<Address, Int> compiled and executed correctly.
   • Attempts to use disallowed key types such as String or user-defined struct types were consistently rejected by the compiler, producing clear compile-time errors, exactly as specified in the documentation.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   • According to the official specifications (see   and accompanying sections), allowed value types include Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types. We confirmed that maps holding any of these value types behave as expected.
   • Furthermore, only Int keys (and values) support serialization formats (e.g., using "as uint8"). Our TestSerializedMap snippet validates that serialized maps operate properly without any unexpected behavior.

3. Core Map Operations:
   • Our tests of the core map operations – insertion (.set), querying (.get and .exists), updating (.replace and .replaceGet), and deletion (.del or by setting a key to null) – all behaved in full accordance with the documented semantics. For example, replacing an existing key returned the correct previous value or a boolean flag based on success.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration Constraints:
   • We successfully implemented nested maps by embedding an inner map within a structure (e.g., AllowanceMap) and then storing it in an outer map keyed by an Address. Iteration over such nested maps was validated to work properly only when accessed as a valid path expression (i.e., using self.data). Attempts to iterate over maps returned from function expressions correctly resulted in compilation errors, as per the language restrictions mentioned in the documentation (see citeturn8file for iteration guidelines).

5. Equality Comparisons:
   • Finally, our tests confirmed that shallow equality (using the '==' operator) and deep equality (via .deepEquals()) perform their roles as detailed: shallow equality compares the underlying serialized cell hashes, while deep equality does an entry-by-entry comparison. This distinction was accurately reproduced in our tests.

Conclusion:
-----------
After an exhaustive series of tests designed to thoroughly probe every edge case, our fuzz-testing cycle established that:

- The Tact compiler enforces key type restrictions precisely as documented (only Int and Address are allowed).
- Map value types, including support for serialization on Ints, work as specified.
- All documented operations on maps function reliably and return expected results.
- Nested maps and iteration are supported under well-defined constraints.
- The differentiation between shallow and deep equality is correctly implemented.

No discrepancies, compiler bugs, or deviations from the official Tact documentation were discovered during this cycle. Our results fully confirm that maps in Tact operate exactly as described in the official documentation.
