/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Maps in Tact

This testing cycle focused on the implementation and documented behavior of maps (dictionaries) in Tact, with special attention to key/value types, operations, serialization, nested maps, iteration, and edge-case behaviors. Below is a summary of our testing process and findings:

1. Allowed Key Types:
   • We confirmed from documentation that maps only accept Int and Address as keys (see   and  ).
   • Attempting to use a String as a key (or any type other than Int and Address) correctly produces a compile-time error. This behavior is exemplified by our TestInvalidKey snippet.
   • Using a struct as a key was similarly rejected, matching the allowed types note in the documentation.

2. Allowed Value Types and Serialization:
   • Our tests verified that maps can hold values of types such as Int, Bool, and serialized versions of Int (e.g., Int as uint8). The TestSerializedMap and TestMapBoolFixed snippets confirm that both plain and serialized integers can be stored as keys or values. Documentation explains that only maps with Int keys have support for serialization formats (see  ).

3. Operations on Maps (Insertion, Replacement, Deletion, and Queries):
   • Operations such as .set(), .get(), .exists(), .replace(), .replaceGet(), and .del() perform as expected. The TestMapOps and TestMapSummary snippets demonstrate that these operations follow the documented semantics: replacing a value returns the correct boolean or old value and deleting an entry via assigning null (or using .del()) works as expected (see   and  ).

4. Nested Maps and Iteration:
   • For nested maps, we wrapped an inner map in a struct (AllowanceMap) and then inserted it into an outer map keyed by Address. Our tests highlighted some syntactical nuances (state variables must be accessed as path expressions, e.g. self.data) and confirmed that iteration via the foreach construct works only on valid path expressions, as documented in  .
   • Attempting to iterate over maps returned directly from function calls correctly produced errors, matching the warning in the documentation.

5. Shallow versus Deep Equality:
   • Our TestMapDeepEquals snippet verified the difference between shallow equality (which compares underlying map hashes) and deep equality (which compares actual key-value pairs using .deepEquals()). Alterations to one map led to differences in both comparisons, in line with the documentation description (see   and  ).

6. Edge-Case and Boundary Scenarios:
   • Additional edge scenarios tested included using Boolean values in maps (TestMapBoolFixed) and ensuring that if/else constructs interact with map retrieval correctly. These tests reconfirm that Bool is an allowed value type.

Overall, all our findings are consistent with the official Tact documentation. The Tact compiler rejects maps with disallowed key types and correctly implements map operations, serialization, nested maps, and iteration limitations as specified.

Conclusion:
No discrepancies between documented behavior and actual compiler behavior were observed based on our comprehensive tests. All edge cases and operations behaved exactly as the Tact documentation describes.
