// Comprehensive Fuzz Testing Report

// In this initial fuzz-testing cycle, we examined multiple sections of the Tact documentation and constructed minimal code snippets to validate documented claims.
//
// Detailed findings:
//
// 1. Variable Declarations:
//    - An attempt to declare a variable using 'var' resulted in a compilation error, reaffirming that only 'let' is supported for variable declarations as specified by the language.
//
// 2. Getter Functions:
//    - Documentation (see  ) clearly states that getters cannot modify state. However, our testing with a contract where a getter function modifies a state variable (by assigning self.x = 42 inside a getter) compiled successfully. This behavior confirms an acknowledged discrepancy: getters are allowed to modify state at runtime, but these modifications do not persist after the TVM run.
//
// 3. Loop Constructs and Conditionals:
//    - Our while loop test, incrementing a state variable until a condition is met, compiled and behaved as expected (refer to   and   for sections on control flow).
//    - The repeat loop was tested with a negative number and behaved as documented (the loop body is skipped when the iteration count is negative). 
//    - Basic if/else constructs compiled as expected, and behave in accordance with documentation (see   for conditional syntax).
//
// Conclusion:
//
// No severe issues or new discrepancies were detected in this cycle. All tested features—from variable declarations (limiting to 'let'), loop constructs, and conditionals—operate per the official documentation expectations except for the documented mismatch regarding state modifications in getter functions.
//
// Next steps include further exploratory testing of additional features (like more complex control flow, assembly functions, and mapping usage) to continue verifying compiler consistency versus documentation.
//
// This cycle confirms that, apart from previously recognized issues (e.g., state modifications in getters), the Tact compiler behavior aligns with expectations as per the documentation.
