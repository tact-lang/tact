// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Summary Report: Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality

/*
Overview:
---------
This fuzz-testing cycle was dedicated to a deep exploration of bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts, as guided by the Tact documentation. Our tests explicitly targeted:

• Standard scenarios for bounce receivers (using a custom message type such as bounced<MyMessage>).
• Validation of invalid receiver definitions (e.g., using improper types like Int or Cell, or declaring the bounce receiver without parameters).
• Fallback behavior by handling all bounced messages using a Slice parameter.
• State modifications within bounce receivers (e.g., updating a counter).
• Enforcement of unique bounce receiver rules by ensuring that multiple declarations for the same message type trigger conflicts.
• Advanced handling with control flow constructs (try-catch blocks within bounce receivers) and recursive/cross-contract bounce handling (using self.reply() and self.notify()).
• Enforcement of the 224 usable data bits limit for bounced messages.

Key Findings:
-------------
1. Valid bounce receiver declarations compile correctly and behave as documented. For example, using:
   bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
   adheres to the guidelines stated in the bounced messages documentation [ ].

2. Bounce receivers with an invalid parameter type (e.g., Int or Cell) or without any parameters trigger the correct compile-time errors, consistent with the requirement that only bounced<T>, message, or Slice types are allowed.

3. Fallback receivers defined to accept a Slice (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compile correctly, providing a catch-all mechanism for bounced messages.

4. State modifications within bounce receivers are permitted (e.g., incrementing a counter in a bounced receiver), aligning with the behavior described in the contracts documentation [ ].

5. Defining multiple bounce receivers for the same message type yields a conflict error, ensuring unique handling for each bounced message type.

6. Advanced constructs such as try-catch blocks within bounce receivers (after slight syntactical adjustment) compile successfully, and recursive or cross-contract interactions (using self.reply() and self.notify()) function as expected.

7. Attempts to manipulate bounced message data that exceed the 224-bit usable limit produce the appropriate compile-time error, enforcing the documented size constraint mentioned in the bounced messages documentation [ ].

Conclusion:
-----------
The extensive fuzz-testing cycle confirmed that the Tact compiler's behavior for bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality fully aligns with the official documentation. All scenarios—ranging from typical use cases to edge-case and error conditions—yield the expected outcomes without any discrepancies or unexpected behavior.

This provides a high level of confidence in the robustness and compliance of bounce handling within Tact contracts.

Next Steps: 
-------------
Having completed thorough fuzz-testing for bounced messages, further testing cycles will continue to explore additional language features.
