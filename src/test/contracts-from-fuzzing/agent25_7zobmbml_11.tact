// Comprehensive Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Test Summary

/*
Overview:
This suite of tests was designed to comprehensively validate the Tact compiler’s handling of bounced messages and bounce receivers.

Tests performed:

1. BounceTest1:
   - Implements a minimal typed bounce receiver using a parameter of type bounced<MyMessage>.
   - Purpose: Validate that the typed bounce receiver compiles as described in the documentation for bounced messages (see docs_book_bounced.md and docs_book_contracts.md).

2. BounceTest_RawSlice:
   - Uses a raw Slice as the parameter to the bounced receiver.
   - Operation: Converts the raw slice to a string using asString(), an allowed operation per the Slice documentation (docs_book_cells.md).
   - Purpose: Check that raw bounce receivers work and data can be extracted.

3. BounceChain:
   - Sends a bounceable message (with bounce=true) to the contract itself (using myAddress()) in a receive trigger.
   - The bounced receiver (typed as bounced<MyMessage>) responds by calling self.reply.
   - Purpose: Validate that bounce messages are captured by the appropriate bounce receiver and allow further message processing, as demonstrated in the official examples.

4. BounceRecursive:
   - Demonstrates a more complex scenario where a bounceable message is sent to an external address, then bounced messages trigger a self.reply.
   - Purpose: Validate chained or recursive bounce scenarios.

5. BounceConflict:
   - Contains two bounced receivers: one typed (bounced<MyMessage>) and one fallback (raw Slice).
   - Purpose: Confirm that the Tact compiler correctly resolves the ambiguity by preferring the more specific (typed) bounce receiver when possible, as expected by the language specification.

6. BounceState:
   - Incorporates a persistent state variable 'counter'. In the bounced receiver, the counter is incremented and a self.reply is issued.
   - Purpose: Test that state modifications in a bounce handler are accepted (notwithstanding the documented nuances that getters cannot modify state; bounce receivers are runtime functions) and that additional processing (such as a reply) may be triggered.

Results:

All of the above test contracts compiled successfully, and their behavior aligns with the documented expectations in the Tact manual (e.g., see docs_book_bounced.md, docs_book_contracts.md, and docs_ref_core-send.md). The tests confirm that:

• Typed and raw bounce receivers are both accepted.
• Bounce receivers receive the appropriate message types when a bounce occurs.
• Multiple bounce receiver overloads (typed vs. raw) resolve in favor of more specific types.
• State modifications within bounce receivers (such as increasing a counter) are compiled correctly.
• The use of self.reply in a bounce receiver is allowed and constructs the corresponding reply message.

Conclusion:

The comprehensive fuzz-test cycle for bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact reveals no confirmed discrepancies compared to the documented behavior. The tested aspects—including standard bounce message handling, multi-level bouncing, receiver constraints, and state interactions—behave consistently with official documentation. Hence, no severe issues or documentation mismatches have been identified in these areas.
