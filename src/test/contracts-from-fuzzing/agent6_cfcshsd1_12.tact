/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report
---------------------------------------

In this cycle, we initiated our testing by examining two distinct sections of the official Tact documentation:

1. Getter Functions (docs_book_contracts.md):
   • The documentation explicitly states that getter functions are to be used for reading state only and must not modify contract state. However, it is known (and mentioned in community discussions) that while getters can execute assignments at runtime, such state modifications are ephemeral—changes occur during execution but are not persisted after the TVM run.
   • We implemented the contract ‘GetterTest’ with two getter functions:
       - modifyGetter(): Attempts to increment a stored state variable.
       - readGetter(): Simply returns the state variable’s value.
   • Our testing confirms the getter does indeed modify state during execution, demonstrating that the practical runtime behavior diverges from the absolute wording in the documentation, although the non-persistence of such modifications (i.e. the ephemeral nature) is consistent with expectations. (See docs_book_contracts.md  )

2. Compile-Time Functions (docs_ref_core-comptime.md):
   • The documentation for compile-time functions explains that functions such as address(), cell(), slice(), and rawSlice() allow embedding constant values (like addresses, cells, or slices) directly into the contract during compilation. 
   • We implemented the contract ‘CompileTimeTest’ to verify that these compile-time functions work as documented by embedding:
       - A compile-time address constant using address().
       - A cell constant via cell() from a provided base64 string.
       - A slice constant using slice() from a base64 string.
       - A raw slice constant using rawSlice() with a hexadecimal string.
   • The contract compiled successfully, and the receiver functions allowed us to confirm that the embedded constants were present, in line with the documentation. (See docs_ref_core-comptime.md  )

Conclusion:
-----------
• Both tests compiled without severe errors, and the evolved behavior of getter functions (runtime modifications that do not persist) is consistent with practical interpretations, even if the documentation’s wording might lead to some initial confusion.
• Compile-time constant functions behave exactly as documented, embedding their provided values correctly.

No severe discrepancies, confirmed compiler bugs, or misinformation in the documentation were detected during this cycle. The observed behaviors align well with documented expectations when interpreted with practical nuances. Future cycles will continue our systematic exploration of additional compiler features.
