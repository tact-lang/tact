// Final Answer Summary for Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Testing

/*

Our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle for bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact has covered multiple key aspects:

1. Valid Bounce Receivers:
   - Bounce receivers defined with the proper syntax (using the bounced<T> wrapper) compile successfully, ensuring that messages are handled as documented (see docs_book_bounced.md  ).
   - Fallback bounce receivers using a raw Slice parameter were confirmed to capture all bounced messages.

2. Invalid Receiver Definitions:
   - Attempting to define a bounce receiver without the bounced<T> wrapper (e.g. using a plain message type) reliably triggers a compile-time error, in line with the required type enforcement.
   - Likewise, attempts at accessing non-existent fields within a bounced message produce the expected error, ensuring correct adherence to type definitions.
   - Also, bounced receivers for text messages are not permitted, yielding a compilation error as per the constraints outlined in the documentation.

3. Multi-Contract Recursive Bouncing:
   - Our tests included a scenario where one contract (BounceChainA) sends a bounce-enabled message to a target contract that lacks any receiver (BounceChainB), causing the message to bounce back. The bounce receiver in BounceChainA then increments a counter, verifying that the bouncing mechanism operates as specified in Tactâ€™s design (refer to docs_book_contracts.md  ).

In summary, all valid bounce receiver patterns operate as expected, and invalid or erroneous definitions produce the correct compile-time errors. The observed compiler behavior shows complete consistency with the official Tact documentation regarding bounced messages.

No discrepancies or confirmed compiler bugs were found during our extensive tests in this area.
