/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
This fuzz-testing cycle targeted the behavior and implementation of maps (dictionaries) in Tact. Our aim was to rigorously validate that the compiler enforces the documented constraints regarding key/value types, serialization functionality, basic operations (insertion, querying, updating, deletion), nested map handling, iteration rules, and equality comparisons.

Documentation Basis:
----------------------
According to the official Tact documentation on maps (refer to  ,  , and  ):

1. Allowed Key Types:
   • Only Int and Address are permitted as key types.
   • Tests confirmed that maps declared as map<Int, Int> or map<Address, Int> compile and behave correctly (see TestMapValid and TestAddressKey).
   • Any attempt to use disallowed key types such as String or a user-defined struct triggers a compilation error, conforming with documentation (TestInvalidKey and TestStructKey).

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   • Permissible value types include Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types (structs/messages), while only Int supports serialization (e.g., Int as uint8), as detailed in  .
   • Our tests with serialized maps (TestSerializedMap) show that specifying a serialization format yields expected results.

3. Core Map Operations:
   • Fundamental operations (.set, .get, .exists, .replace, .replaceGet, .del) are documented and function as expected (see examples in   and  ).
   • Tests such as TestMapOps and TestMapSummary verified that:
       - Insertion via .set associates the key with the value.
       - Querying via .get and .exists returns correct outcomes.
       - Replacement operations behave correctly (including deletion by assigning null).

4. Nested Maps & Iteration:
   • Nested maps were examined using a struct (AllowanceMap) that encapsulates an inner map, which is then stored in an outer map keyed by Address (see   for nested maps example).
   • The foreach iteration construct is strictly limited to valid path expressions (like self.data); attempts to iterate on maps returned from functions trigger compile-time errors, as documented.

5. Equality Comparisons:
   • A critical distinction exists between shallow equality (using the '==' operator, which compares underlying cell hashes) and deep equality (using .deepEquals, which compares each key-value pair). Our tests verified that altering an entry leads to predictable differences in both comparisons, exactly as described in the documentation (refer to  ).

6. Edge Case – Boolean Values:
   • Maps with Bool values (as in TestMapBoolFixed) compile and execute correctly within standard conditional constructs.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle confirms that the Tact compiler adheres completely to the official documentation on maps:
  - Only allowed key types (Int and Address) are accepted, and invalid key types are rejected with clear errors.
  - Allowed value types, including serialized Int types, function as specified.
  - All standard operations work in line with the documented semantics.
  - Nested map composition and iteration constraints are properly enforced.
  - Shallow versus deep equality distinctions are correctly implemented.

No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were identified during this cycle. All tests validated that the Tact compiler’s implementation supports maps precisely as detailed in the documentation.
