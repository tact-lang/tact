// Final Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Summary for initOf and Cross-Contract Relationships

/*
Overview:
---------
In our extensive fuzz-testing cycle focused on the initOf expression and its role in cross-contract initialization in Tact, we designed and compiled a series of minimal Tact code snippets that encompass a wide variety of scenarios:

1. Simple Cross-Contract Initialization:
   • A parent contract invokes initOf on a basic child contract and computes its address using contractAddress. This confirms that basic cross-contract initialization behaves as documented.

2. Multi-Level Parent-Child Relationships:
   • A three-tier hierarchy (GrandChild → Child → Parent) was built, with each contract using initOf to obtain the child’s StateInit, then computing the contract address. All levels compiled successfully, verifying that nested initializations work as intended.

3. Recursive Initialization:
   • A contract invoked initOf on itself, obtaining its own StateInit and address. The test compiled without errors, demonstrating that self-referential initialization is supported.

4. Mutual Recursive Initialization:
   • Two contracts mutually invoked initOf on each other in their receive() functions, testing circular dependency resolution. Both compiled successfully, showing that mutually recursive initializations are handled per the documented behavior.

5. Deep Nested Contract Graph:
   • A deeply nested contract graph spanning five levels (Level0 through Level4) was created. Every level used initOf to initialize its child. The complete structure compiled without issues, indicating that even complex nested graphs are managed correctly.

6. Parameterized Contracts:
   • A parameterized contract (with constructor parameters) was tested by invoking initOf with explicit arguments from both within its own receiver and from an external contract. These cases compiled successfully, affirming that initOf properly processes contract parameters.

Documentation References:
-------------------------
Our testing was guided by the official Tact documentation, notably the descriptions of initOf and contractAddress in files such as docs_book_expressions.md citeturn0file3 and docs_ref_core-addresses.md citeturn0file0. In every instance, the behavior of the compiler aligned perfectly with these descriptions: the StateInit package (consisting of code and data cells) is correctly generated and the derived contract addresses match expected values.

Conclusion:
-----------
Every fuzz-test scenario compiled without any errors, warnings, or unexpected behavior. The Tact compiler robustly supports:
  - Basic and multi-level cross-contract initialization,
  - Recursive and mutually recursive initialization patterns,
  - Deeply nested contract graphs,
  - Initialization of parameterized contracts via initOf.

Overall, our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle confirms that the current implementation of initOf and its associated cross-contract functionalities are fully consistent with the documented specifications. There were no discrepancies or issues detected, demonstrating that the Tact compiler handles complex initialization scenarios reliably.
