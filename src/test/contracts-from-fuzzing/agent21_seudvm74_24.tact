// Advanced Fuzz Testing Report for Bounce Message Handling and Error Management

/*
Overview:
-----------
Over the course of this extended fuzz-testing cycle, we have deeply investigated the bounce message receiver functionality along with advanced error handling via try-catch (including nested try-catch) in the Tact compiler/runtime.

Key Findings:
-------------
1. Try-Catch in Bounced Message Handlers:
   - We created a contract (TryCatchTest) that triggers a runtime division-by-zero error when a field extracted from an incoming message (dummy) evaluates so that (dummy - 1) = 0. The error is caught by a try-catch block, and the error code is stored in a persistent variable. 
   - This behavior confirms that runtime errors (such as division-by-zero) are caught properly and reported with the correct exit code (expected exit code 4 for math errors) as per the official documentation regarding integer operations (see docs_book_integers.md citeturn0file0 and citeturn0file1).

2. Nested Try-Catch Handling:
   - We implemented a contract (NestedTryCatchTest2) that uses nested try-catch blocks. In the outer block, a division error is triggered when subtracting from a message field. In the inner block, a call to log with an invalid base (0) is used to force another error.
   - Nested error handling captured the inner error code (expected to be exit code 5 for invalid parameter range) and stored it in a state variable. This confirms that error codes propagate correctly in nested try-catch constructs.

3. Bounce Message Recursion and Payload Limits:
   - Initial experiments with a bounced message structure that used a wider integer type exceeded the 224 usable data bits limit for bounced messages. Adjusting the field type by serializing as a fixed-width uint (using 'Int as uint64') solved the problem.
   - The contract BounceRecursive5, which recursively emits bounced messages with an incrementing counter until a given threshold, compiled and operates as expected without running afoul of payload size limits. This behavior is consistent with the documented limitations (see docs_book_bounced.md citeturn0file0).

4. Overall Compliance with Documentation:
   - All tests, covering advanced error handling through try-catch, nested try-catch logic, and bounce message recursive behavior, behaved in strict accordance with official Tact documentation. Error codes such as 4 and 5 are triggered when expected, and payload size restrictions for bounced messages are enforced.

Conclusion:
-------------
Our comprehensive and systematic fuzz testing of bounce message handling and associated error management features has not uncovered any significant discrepancies or severe bugs in the Tact compiler. Advanced error handling with try-catch (including nested cases) and bounce receiver behavior are implemented as documented. 

We will remain persistent in exploring further features, but this cycle confirms the robustness and accuracy of these aspects of the compiler.
