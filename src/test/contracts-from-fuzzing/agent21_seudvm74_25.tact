// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Report (Continued)

/*
Overview:
-----------
In our continued deep and systematic fuzz-testing cycle of the Tact compiler, we focused on validated and exploring advanced aspects of bounce message handling, error propagation via try-catch (including nested try-catch blocks), and recursive bounce message operations.

Key Highlights:
-------------
1. Try-Catch in Bounced Message Handlers:
   - Our contract TryCatchTest triggers a runtime division-by-zero error when processing a bounced message. Instead of a compile-time error, the error is detected during the execution phase and is successfully captured by the try-catch mechanism. This confirms that runtime math errors (such as division by zero, expected to yield exit code 4) are correctly caught and reported.

2. Nested Try-Catch Handling:
   - In NestedTryCatchTest2, we layered error-inducing operations in nested try-catch blocks. An outer error (division by zero derived from message data) is caught, and within that catch block, a second error (invalid log operation with base 0) is triggered. The nested error is captured as expected (with an exit code corresponding to an invalid parameter range, i.e. exit code 5). This confirms that nested try-catch structures propagate and capture errors accurately.

3. Bounce Message Recursion and Payload Limit Enforcement:
   - Earlier tests using an overly wide integer field for bounced messages resulted in compilation errors due to surpassing the 224 available data bits limit. By switching the field type to a narrower fixed-width integer (using serialization as uint64), the contract BounceRecursive5 compiles and works as expected. It recursively bounces messages while incrementing a counter until reaching a threshold, all while staying within the payload size restrictions. This behavior matches the Tact documentation regarding bounced message limitations.

4. General Compliance:
   - All advanced error handling and bounce receiver scenarios that we explored—including try-catch error capture, nested error propagation, and recursive bounce message behavior—have acted in full accordance with the documented behavior in the Tact language specifications (see docs_book_bounced.md citeturn0file0, docs_book_integers.md citeturn0file0, and related sections).

Further Exploration:
----------------------
At this point, our targeted fuzz tests for bounce message handling and error management (including nested try-catch constructs) have revealed no discrepancies or bugs. Future testing plans include:
  • Combining various message-sending modes (e.g., SendRemainingValue vs. SendRemainingBalance) with advanced state-update scenarios.
  • Exploring interactions between getter functions and state modifications in complex contract flows (while avoiding known issues).
  • Testing multi-contract interactions where bounced messages traverse several contracts and verifying that all bounce handlers are invoked in the correct order.
  • Evaluating edge cases in serialization and deserialization of messages with mixed types, ensuring that optional fields and fallback receivers behave as documented.

Conclusion:
-------------
Our continued, rigorous fuzz-testing of these advanced features has not uncovered any significant compiler bugs or mismatches with the official Tact documentation at this time. The Tact compiler appears robust in its handling of bounced messages, error propagation via try-catch (including nested cases), and satisfaction of payload limitations.

We remain committed and will persist in exploring further compiler features systematically. As of now, all observed behaviors are aligned with the intended and documented design.
