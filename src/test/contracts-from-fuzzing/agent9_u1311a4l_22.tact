// Final Comprehensive Summary Report for Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Testing

// Overview:
// This fuzz-testing cycle focused on the behavior of bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts, as described in the official documentation.

// Key Tests Executed:

// 1. Standard Bounce Receiver Declaration:
//    - Defined bounce receiver using 'bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>)' with a custom message type, which compiled and behaved as expected.

// 2. Invalid Receiver Parameter Types:
//    - Tested bounce receivers with incorrect parameter types (e.g., 'Int' and 'Cell'), which correctly produced compile-time errors stating that only bounced<T>, message, or Slice are allowed.
//    - Also confirmed that a bounce receiver declared without any parameters triggers an expected error.

// 3. Fallback Bounce Receiver Using Slice:
//    - Created a bounce receiver accepting a raw Slice to catch all bounced messages (i.e., 'bounced(rawMsg: Slice)'). This compiled successfully, validating the fallback method recommended by the docs.

// 4. State Modifications Within Bounce Receivers:
//    - Verified that state updates (e.g., incrementing a counter) in bounce receivers are permitted, in contrast with the limitations of getter functions.

// 5. Duplicate Bounce Receiver Conflict:
//    - Attempted to define two bounce receivers for the same message type in a single contract and observed a conflict compile error. This enforces the rule of a single bounce receiver per message type in a contract.

// 6. Try-Catch within Bounce Receivers:
//    - Introduced error handling using try-catch within a bounce receiver. After a minor syntax correction (proper catch parameter), the use of try-catch worked as expected.

// 7. Recursive and Cross-Contract Bounce Handling:
//    - Tested scenarios where a bounced receiver used self.reply() and self.notify() to send messages, including cross-contract interactions. These advanced cases compiled and followed documented behavior.

// 8. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
//    - Created a test case where an operation on a bounced message would exceed the 224-bit usable data limit. The compiler raised the appropriate error, ensuring strict enforcement of the message size constraint.

// Conclusion:
// Every scenario we tested (including both standard and edge cases) aligned with the official Tact documentation. The bounce receiver functionality was validated, with all compiler errors and behaviors matching expected and documented rules.
// No discrepancies or undocumented behavior were identified during this cycle.

// Fuzz-Testing Cycle Result:
// The Tact compilerâ€™s handling of bounced messages and bounce receivers adheres correctly to the specifications. Fuzz-testing on this feature is thus successful, and testing continues into further areas in subsequent cycles.

// End of Report.
