// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Report Summary
//
// In this initial fuzz-testing cycle, we selected a section of the official Tact documentation that focuses on key language constructs and features. Our fuzzing examined:
//
// 1. Variable Declarations:
//    - An attempted declaration using 'var' was rejected by the compiler, enforcing that only 'let' is allowed. This behavior directly aligns with the language specification.
//
// 2. Getter Functions:
//    - According to the documentation (docs_book_contracts.md), getter functions should be read-only and not modify state. Nevertheless, our test contract (ModifyGetter) deliberately modified a state variable within a getter. The code compiled successfully, confirming the known discrepancy that while runtime modifications in getters occur, they are not persisted after the TVM run.
//
// 3. Control Flow Constructs and Loop Behavior:
//    - Conditional constructs (if/else) compiled as expected, accurately reflecting the documentation examples.
//    - A while loop (in the WhileTest contract) that incremented a state variable until a condition was satisfied behaved exactly as documented.
//    - A repeat loop test using a negative iteration count correctly skipped the loop’s body, in accordance with the specified behavior.
//
// Conclusion:
//    • The tested features (variable declarations, getter functions, loops, and conditionals) behave in accordance with their documented behavior, except for the known discrepancy regarding getter functions.
//    • No new severe issues, internal errors, or discrepancies between the documentation and the compiler behavior were observed in this cycle.
//
// Next Steps:
// We will continue our fuzz-testing in subsequent cycles by targeting additional language features such as assembly functions, map operations, and intricate syntax constructs.
//
// This completes the current comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle without encountering any new bugs or documentation mismatches that would necessitate a stop.
