// Final Fuzz-Testing Summary for initOf and Cross-Contract Relationships in Tact

/*
Overview:
---------
Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle for the initOf expression in Tact centered on its use to generate a contract's initial state (StateInit) and its role in establishing cross-contract relationships – notably through the contractAddress function. We designed a diverse suite of minimal Tact code snippets to systematically evaluate:

1. Simple cross-contract initialization, where a parent contract invokes initOf on a child contract and computes the resulting address via contractAddress.

2. Multi-level parent-child relationships featuring a three-tier hierarchy (GrandChild → Child → Parent) to confirm that nested initializations are fully supported.

3. Recursive initialization, wherein a contract calls initOf on itself (self-referential initialization), which compiled successfully.

4. Mutual recursive initialization, where two contracts mutually invoke initOf on each other, thereby testing the compiler's handling of circular dependencies.

5. Deep nested contract graphs, implemented as a five-level nested structure (from Level0 through Level4), to validate robust support for complex nesting.

6. Parameterized contracts, which use constructor parameters and are instantiated via initOf, demonstrating that the expression properly handles contract parameters.

All code snippets compiled without any errors or unexpected behavior, and the observed outcomes – such as the generated StateInit packages and computed contract addresses – precisely align with the documented specifications (as described in docs_book_expressions.md and docs_ref_core-addresses.md).

Conclusion:
-----------
Our comprehensive fuzz-testing confirms that the Tact compiler robustly implements the initOf functionality and its interplay with cross-contract relationships. Whether in simple or complex scenarios (including recursive, mutually recursive, and deeply nested constructions), the behavior of initOf and the derived contract addresses adhere strictly to the official documentation, with no discrepancies detected.
