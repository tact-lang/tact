// Comprehensive Fuzz Testing Cycle for Bounced Messages and Bounce Receivers
// ================================================================
// In this cycle, we explored the Tact documentation regarding bounced messages and bounce receivers (see citeturn0file1, citeturn0file3, and citeturn0file9), and we conducted a series of detailed fuzz tests to examine various aspects:
//
// 1. Basic Usage of Typed Bounced Receiver:
//    • BounceTestEmpty: This contract sends an outbound message with bounce: true, and a bounced receiver accepting bounced<EmptyMsg> is defined. 
//      The compiler accepted the code, and the receiver’s logic (setting a Boolean flag) was confirmed as adhering to the documented behavior.
//
// 2. Fallback Bounced Receiver Handling:
//    • BounceFallback: We defined a fallback bounced receiver that accepts any bounced message as a raw Slice. The contract compiled and updated its state accordingly, confirming the flexibility documented for fallback receivers.
//
// 3. Enforcement of Bounced Receiver Argument Type:
//    • An attempt to define a bounced receiver with a non-struct type (e.g. bounced<String>) produced a compile-time error, consistent with the requirement that only a structured message type be allowed.
//
// 4. Multi-level and Chained Bounce Scenarios:
//    • BounceSender in combination with BounceReceiverMissing was used to simulate a bounce event when the target contract does not implement a receive function, with the bounced message properly captured into a bounced<SmallMsg>.
//    • ChainBounce with ChainNonResponder demonstrated chained bounce reactions, where sequential bounced events trigger further outbound messages before reaching a final state. All state transitions were processed as expected.
//
// 5. Enforcing the 224-byte Bounced Message Data Limit:
//    • An earlier test (not in the final code, but observed during our cycle) confirmed that if a message type exceeding 224 bytes is used for a bounced message, attempts to access its fields result in a compile-time error. This confirms proper enforcement of the documentation’s limit.
//
// In summary, our systematic testing validated the following documented aspects:
// – Bounce receivers accepting properly structured message types compile and work as expected.
// – Fallback bounce receivers (using raw Slice parameters) correctly capture any bounced messages.
// – Non-struct message types are not accepted in bounced receivers, as enforced by the compiler.
// – Multi-level and chained bouncing scenarios behave consistently with documented expectations.
//
// No discrepancies, unexpected behavior, or compiler bugs were identified in these tests.
//
// We will now continue to explore other Tact features, but for bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality, the official Tact documentation and observed behavior are in full alignment.
