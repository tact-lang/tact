// Final Summary for the Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Testing Cycle

// Overview:
// This fuzz-testing cycle rigorously examined the behavior of bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts. Our approach was to:
// • Validate common use cases from the documentation, such as defining a bounce receiver with a custom message type (e.g., bounced<MyMessage>).
// • Deliberately test invalid and edge-case scenarios by using inappropriate parameter types (e.g., Int, Cell) or omitting required parameters, all of which resulted in proper compile-time errors.
// • Verify fallback behavior using a Slice parameter in the bounce receiver, ensuring that a contract can capture all bounced messages.
// • Test that state modifications inside bounce receivers (for instance, updating a counter) are allowed and function as intended (as opposed to getters which cannot modify state).
// • Confirm that multiple bounce receivers for the same message type trigger a conflict, preventing ambiguity.
// • Evaluate advanced error handling with try-catch inside bounce receivers, with necessary syntax adjustments, to ensure that error recovery mechanisms are supported.
// • Create cross-contract and recursive bounce handling scenarios using self.reply() and self.notify(), all of which compiled and behaved according to documentation.
// • Assess message size limitations by testing operations that exceed the 224-bit usable data limit for bounced messages, which appropriately resulted in compile-time errors.

// Key Documentation References:
// - Bounced messages details (docs_book_bounced.md),
// - Contract receiver and bounce receiver specifications (docs_book_contracts.md),
// - Outbound messaging behavior (docs_book_send.md).

// Conclusion:
// All tests performed—including both typical cases and challenging edge cases—confirmed that the Tact compiler enforces the documented constraints and intended behavior. Specifically:
// • Valid bounce receiver declarations compile as expected when using types like bounced<MyMessage> or Slice.
// • Invalid declarations are rightly rejected with clear error messages.
// • State modifications in bounce receivers function normally.
// • Advanced constructs such as try-catch and inter-contract bounce handling work as intended.
// • Message size constraints (224 usable data bits) are correctly enforced.

// Result: The fuzz-testing cycle did not reveal any discrepancies or bugs between the documented behavior and the actual Tact compiler behavior regarding bounced messages and bounce receivers. The implementation is robust and adheres to specifications.

// Fuzz-Testing Cycle Outcome: No anomalies detected. The testing continues into further language features in subsequent cycles.
