Comprehensive Report: Assembly Functions Testing Cycle

Overview:
This test suite was designed to rigorously assess Tact’s asm functions feature as documented in the official Tact documentation (see  ,  , and others).

Test Highlights:
1. Basic TVM Instruction Execution:
   - Function ‘answer’ uses a literal and PUSHINT. It compiles and returns 42 as expected.
   (Reference:  )

2. Primitive Verification:
   - A function ‘bad’ containing a standalone primitive followed by no TVM instruction was rejected by the compiler. This confirms the requirement that primitives must immediately precede a TVM instruction (Reference:  ).

3. Parameter Ordering & Stack Manipulation:
   - ‘swapPair’ swaps two parameters using SWAP and captures the values into a struct, confirming that parameters are pushed in order (first pushed at bottom, last on top), and the SWAP correctly reverses their order.
   (References:  ,  )

4. Return Arrangement Testing:
   - ‘swapReturn’ declared with the asm(-> 1 0) arrangement successfully reorders the return values, consistent with documentation on stack arrangements (Reference:  ).

5. Struct Flattening in Parameters:
   - ‘addAB’ confirms that a struct parameter (AB with fields a and b) is flattened such that its values are pushed in order (first field first, then second), so that ADD correctly sums them.
   (Reference:  )

6. Additional Comprehensive Tests:
   - A suite of functions (including push42NoReturn, sumNested, checkDepth, push9, and echo) tested various facets:
       * Ensured that assembly functions without an explicit return type still execute the PUSHINT side-effect properly.
       * Verified nested structure flattening where nested fields are correctly ordered and processed (Reference:  ).
       * Retrieved the TVM stack depth using DEPTH as expected (Reference:  ).
       * Confirmed that TVM instruction opcode variants (like PUSHINT for a value within -5 to 10) are used correctly.
       * An identity function using DUP ('echo') behaved as documented.

Conclusion:
Our thorough testing cycle for Tact's asm functions revealed that all aspects—parameter ordering, struct flattening, TVM instruction usage, and stack arrangements—are implemented in accordance with the official documentation. No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were encountered during our cycle.

This detailed report confirms that the asm functions feature in the Tact compiler works reliably within the documented parameters and edge cases.
