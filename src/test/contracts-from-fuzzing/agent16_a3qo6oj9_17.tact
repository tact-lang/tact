// Final Summary of Comprehensive Testing on asm Functions in Tact

// Our comprehensive testing cycle on asm functions included the following:
//
// 1. Documentation Verification: 
//    We began by retrieving multiple related documentation sections on asm functions using file_search. Key excerpts were obtained from documents such as:
//    - The overview of asm functions and arrangements (see citeturn0file0 and citeturn0file3),
//    - Details regarding TVM instructions and consumption rules (see citeturn0file8),
//    - Attributes and restrictions for asm functions (see citeturn0file7 and citeturn0file6).
//
// 2. Basic Functionality Testing:
//    - We compiled simple asm functions like push42, add, and swap. These tests confirmed that TVM instructions (e.g., PUSHINT, ADD, SWAP) execute and capture return values as documented.
//    - For example, push42 correctly pushes 42 onto the stack and returns it, and add correctly sums its two parameters.
//
// 3. Arrangement and Structure Flattening:
//    - The swap_pair test used the arrangement syntax (asm(a b -> 1 0)) to validate that the flattened order of the arguments and return values matches documentation. This confirmed that structures are flattened properly (first field at the bottom, last field on top) as detailed in the documentation (see citeturn0file0, citeturn0file3).
//    - Similarly, tests using nested structures (sum_nested) confirmed that the proper order is maintained and operations like ADD work as expected on the flattened stack.
//
// 4. Error Detection and Enforcement of Restrictions:
//    - Tests designed to misuse asm instructions—such as providing a primitive (e.g., 43) that is not followed by a consuming TVM instruction, and directly referencing a parameter name (interpreted as a TVM instruction)—correctly produced compilation errors. This behavior precisely follows the documented requirement that primitives must immediately be followed by a consuming TVM instruction, and parameter identifiers cannot be referenced directly in the asm body (see citeturn0file8).
//    - Moreover, our experiment with the 'mutates' attribute confirmed that an asm function annotated as such must also be an extension function, aligning with documentation restrictions (see citeturn0file7).
//
// 5. Additional Utility and Edge Cases:
//    - Tests using TVM instructions like DROP, DEPTH, and DUP confirmed that stack-manipulation instructions function as expected.
//    - The inline attribute was verified to be a no-op, as asm functions are always inlined.
//
// Conclusion:
//    Our extensive cycle of tests has shown that the behavior of asm functions in Tact aligns completely with the documented specifications. All compiled snippets (excluding intentionally erroneous cases) behaved as expected, and error cases produced the correct error messages as per documentation. 
//    There is, therefore, no confirmed evidence of a discrepancy or compiler bug in the implementation of asm functions in Tact, beyond what is already known and documented.
