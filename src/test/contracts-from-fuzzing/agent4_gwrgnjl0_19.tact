/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Maps in Tact
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
Our fuzz-testing cycle has rigorously assessed the behavior of maps (dictionaries) in Tact with special focus on:

• Key and Value Types: We validated that Tact maps restrict keys to only Int and Address, as documented [ ]. Attempts to use disallowed types such as String or Struct produce compile-time errors (see our TestInvalidKey and TestStructKey tests).

• Serialization: Our tests with serialized maps using serialized Int types (e.g. Int as uint8) confirmed that serialization behaves correctly as described in the official docs [ ].

• Map Operations: We systematically verified fundamental map operations:
    - Insertion using .set()
    - Querying with .get() and .exists()
    - Replacement using .replace() and .replaceGet()
    - Deletion using .del() and via assigning a null value
All operations produced expected outcomes, ensuring consistency with documented behavior [ ,  ].

• Nested Maps and Iteration: We tested nested maps scenarios by wrapping an inner map in a struct (e.g. AllowanceMap) and using an outer map (keyed by Address). Iteration via foreach works only with proper path expressions (e.g. self.data), as mandated by the docs [ ].

• Shallow vs Deep Equality: Our tests confirmed that shallow equality (using the '==' operator) compares underlying map hashes, while the .deepEquals() function does an entry-by-entry comparison. Modifications to one map produced differences in equality checks exactly as described [ ].

• Boolean Values: Maps storing Boolean values were also tested using if/else control structures; after minor syntax adjustments, the behavior confirmed that Bool is a valid map value type [ ].

Summary of Findings:
---------------------
1. Allowed key types are strictly enforced: Only Int and Address are permitted, and any deviation results in explicit compilation errors.

2. Allowed value types (Int, Bool, Cell, Address, composite types) work as documented. Serialization options are available for maps with Int keys and values, and these tests passed with expected results.

3. All map operations (.set, .get, .exists, .replace, .replaceGet, .del) work reliably, matching the semantics outlined in the official documentation.

4. Nested map compositions and iteration constraints behave as described: Iteration is only allowed over maps accessed through valid path expressions (like self.data) and not directly over function calls.

5. The difference between shallow and deep equality is correctly implemented.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle found that the Tact compiler’s implementation of maps is consistent with the official documentation. There are no discrepancies or unexpected behaviors in the handling of keys, values, serialization, operations, or nested maps.

All tests have passed successfully.
