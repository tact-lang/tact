// Final Summary Report on Fuzz-Testing Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact

/*
Overview:
----------
This comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle thoroughly examined the bounced messages feature and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts. Our strategy was to validate both standard and edge-case behaviors by creating multiple minimal code snippets and compiling them, in order to confirm that compiler behavior aligns with the official documentation.

Test Categories and Outcomes:
-----------------------------
1. Standard Bounce Receiver Usage:
   • A bounce receiver declared with a custom message type (e.g.,
         bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
     ) compiled successfully, confirming the expected behavior as outlined in the docs.

2. Invalid Receiver Definitions:
   • Bounce receivers defined with an incorrect parameter type (such as Int or Cell) or with no parameter at all produced clear compile-time errors. The error messages explicitly enforce that only types of the form bounced<T>, message, or Slice are permitted. This is entirely consistent with documented constraints.

3. Fallback Receiver Handling:
   • A bounce receiver that uses a raw Slice (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiled correctly, thereby providing a catch-all method to capture any bounced message. This method is documented as a valid approach in the official references.

4. State Modifications within Bounce Receivers:
   • Bounce receivers were shown to allow state modifications (e.g., incrementing a counter), even though getter functions do not have this capability. This confirms that bounce receivers offer the flexibility to update contract state as needed.

5. Duplicate Receiver Prevention:
   • Efforts to define multiple bounce receivers for the same message type resulted in a conflict error. This enforces a one-to-one mapping between bounced messages and their handler, as required by the language specification.

6. Advanced Control Flow (Try-Catch and Recursive Handling):
   • Incorporating try-catch blocks within bounce receivers (after minor syntax adjustments) compiled successfully. Additionally, scenarios involving recursive or cross-contract operations utilizing self.reply() and self.notify() were tested and found to behave as documented.

7. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
   • A test involving operations that would result in a bounced message payload exceeding the 224 usable data bits correctly triggered a compile-time error. This confirms that the compiler enforces the documented size constraint.

Conclusion:
-----------
All tests conducted—including typical valid cases and various edge cases—demonstrate that the Tact compiler’s treatment of bounced messages and bounce receivers is fully compliant with the official documentation. No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were observed in any of our scenarios.

This fuzz-testing cycle confirms that the implementation of bounce handling in Tact contracts is robust, consistent, and aligned with the documented specifications. Further fuzz-testing will continue into other language features.

End of Fuzz-Testing Cycle.
