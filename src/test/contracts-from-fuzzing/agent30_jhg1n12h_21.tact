// Final Summary: Fuzz Testing Cycle on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality
// =============================================================

/*
Overview:
~~~~~~~~~
In this comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle, we explored the handling of bounced messages and bounce receiver functionalities in Tact contracts.

Our testing focused on the following facets:

1. Standard Typed Bounced Receiver Usage:
   • The BounceTestEmpty contract sends an outbound message (with bounce: true) using a simple message (EmptyMsg) and implements a bounced receiver defined as bounced<EmptyMsg> to capture the bounced message. This is fully aligned with the official documentation [citeturn0file1, citeturn0file3].

2. Fallback Bounced Receiver:
   • The BounceFallback contract implements a fallback bounced receiver that accepts any bounced message as a raw Slice. This approach, which allows a more generic handling of bounced messages, compiles correctly and behaves as documented.

3. Enforcement of Structured Types:
   • Our tests included an attempted definition of a bounced receiver with a non-structured type (e.g. bounced<String>). This properly produced a compile error, confirming that only structured message types (like bounced<SomeMsg>) are supported by the compiler.

4. Multi-Level Bouncing and Chained Bounce Scenarios:
   • By using BounceSender in conjunction with a contract lacking a receive function (BounceReceiverMissing), we simulated bounce events and verified that the bounced receiver captures a bounced<SmallMsg>.
   • Furthermore, the ChainBounce and ChainNonResponder contracts illustrated sequential, chained bounce events where each bounce triggers an additional bounceable message until a final state is reached. This behavior is exactly as expected per the documentation.

5. Constraint on Bounced Message Size:
   • We confirmed during early tests that if a message type exceeds the 224 usable data bits limit, attempts to access its fields trigger a compile-time error. This validates the enforcement of the documented size limit on bounced messages.

Results and Conclusion:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every code snippet compiled (or intentionally failed in cases where constraints were breached), confirming that:

   • Typed bounced receivers operate correctly.
   • Fallback bounced receivers successfully capture any bounced message, regardless of its specific type.
   • The compiler enforces the requirement that only structured message types can be used with bounced receivers.
   • Multi-level and chained bounce scenarios function as outlined in the Tact documentation.
   • The 224-bit data limit for bounced messages is strictly enforced.

Thus, throughout our extensive fuzz testing, we observed that the Tact compiler behaves exactly as documented with respect to bounced messages and bounce receivers, with no discrepancies or bugs detected.

Next Steps:
~~~~~~~~~~~
The fuzz-testing process will continue, targeting other advanced language features to ensure system robustness and uncover any potential edge cases.

End of Fuzz-Testing Cycle.
