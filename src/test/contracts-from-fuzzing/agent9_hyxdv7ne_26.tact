// Final result: No significant compiler bug or documentation mismatch was found in our systematic fuzz testing of asm functions in Tact. All behaviors (successful compilations and expected errors) align precisely with the documentation.

/*
Summary:

- Minimal asm functions with proper instructions compile as expected.
- Bare primitives without TVM instructions, direct parameter references, and lowercase TVM mnemonics produce the documented errors.
- Return rearrangements and use of the mutates attribute are strictly enforced according to documentation.
- Struct flattening and parameter arrangements work as documented.
- Complex instruction sequences and unknown instructions yield the acceptable errors and behaviors.

Our extensive suite of over 25 distinct test cases confirms that the Tact compiler behaves consistently with its official documentation regarding asm functions, with no significant issues detected.
