/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Maps in Tact
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
In this fuzz-testing cycle, we extensively examined maps (dictionaries) in Tact with a focus on key and value types, serialization, operations, nested maps, iteration constraints, and equality comparisons. Our tests were designed to verify that the compiler behavior aligns perfectly with the official documentation.

Key Findings:
---------------
1. Allowed Key Types:
   - The official documentation states that only Int and Address are allowed as map keys [ ].
   - Our tests confirmed this: maps defined with key type Int or Address compile and function correctly (e.g., TestMapValid, TestAddressKey).
   - Attempts to define maps with disallowed key types such as String or user-defined Structs were correctly rejected by the compiler, matching the documentation [ ].

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   - Maps can hold values of types such as Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and even composite types, though key serialization is only available for Int keys [ ].
   - Our TestSerializedMap validated that maps with serialized keys and values compile and produce expected outputs.

3. Map Operations (Insertion, Querying, Replacement, Deletion):
   - We verified operations including .set, .get, .exists, .replace, .replaceGet, and .del. All of them behaved as documented [  and  ].
   - For example, replacing an existing key returned the expected boolean value; using replaceGet correctly returned the old value or null, and deletion via both .del and assigning null produced the expected effect.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration:
   - Using nested maps (e.g., wrapping an inner map in a struct to use as a value in an outer map) functions as long as the map is accessed as a proper path expression (e.g., self.data) [ ].
   - Iteration using foreach is correctly limited to identifiers or proper nested field accesses; attempts to iterate over maps returned from functions yield compile-time errors.

5. Shallow vs Deep Equality:
   - Our tests confirmed that shallow equality (using ==) compares only the underlying serialized cell hashes while deepEquals performs an entry-by-entry comparison, as documented [  and  ].

6. Edge Case - Boolean Map Values:
   - When using Bool as a value type, after syntactic adjustments, if/else constructs worked as expected with map retrieval. This confirms that Bool is a permitted value type for maps.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle shows that Tact maps behave exactly as documented:
   • Key types are strictly limited to Int and Address.
   • Allowed value types (including those with serialization) and all map operations work as described.
   • The differentiation between shallow equality (==) and deep equality (deepEquals) is properly implemented.
   • Nested maps and iteration constraints are enforced by the compiler.

No discrepancies between the official documentation and the compiler behavior were observed.
