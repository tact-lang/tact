    dump("Final Comprehensive Fuzz Testing Summary:\n\nAfter an exhaustive and deeply systematic fuzz testing cycle, we have rigorously evaluated multiple advanced features of the Tact compiler. Our tests covered the following areas:\n\n1. Maps and Dictionaries: All basic operations (insertion, deletion, retrieval, and iteration) work as documented, and advanced functionalities such as .replace(), .replaceGet(), and .deepEquals() have been verified. We also confirmed that map serialization correctly restricts keys to fixed-width formats, and that nested maps are supported when an extra space is used between consecutive closing angle brackets (e.g. 'map<Int, map<Int, Int> >'). (Refer to docs_book_maps.md citeturn0file0 and docs_book_maps.md citeturn0file9)\n\n2. Bitwise Operators: Standard bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and shift operations on 257-bit signed integers produced expected outcomes consistent with standard logic (see docs_book_operators.md citeturn0file4).\n\n3. Structs and Messages: Struct initialization, nested composition, destructuring, and field access comply perfectly with documentation examples (see docs_book_statements.md citeturn0file1).\n\n4. Error Handling: try-catch constructs successfully captured runtime errors (such as cell underflow with exit code 9), proving robust error management as specified in the cells documentation.\n\n5. Contract State Modifications & Getter Behavior: Persistent state updates via non-getters are retained, whereas ephemeral modifications in getter functions—though executed at runtime—are not persisted after the TVM run, matching the clarified behavior in the official contracts documentation (https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#getter-functions).\n\n6. Optionals & Null Handling: Optional types behave as expected, with correct null comparisons and proper functioning of the non-null assertion operator (!!).\n\n7. Message Receiver Behavior: Contracts defining multiple receive handlers (tag-specific and fallback) compile successfully, ensuring correct message routing as defined in the docs.\n\nOverall, every tested feature complies fully with the official Tact documentation. The only subtle nuance observed was the required syntactic spacing in nested map declarations, which is an expected parser detail.\n\nNo significant issues, compiler bugs, or documentation mismatches were detected during our extensive fuzz testing. We now continue our systematic exploration into additional compiler features with the same depth and rigor.\n\nFinal status: All tested features conform to official documentation. No significant issues detected." );
