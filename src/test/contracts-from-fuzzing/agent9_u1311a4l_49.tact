// Comprehensive Final Answer: Fuzz-Testing of Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact

/*
Final Summary Report:
---------------------

Through an extensive fuzz-testing cycle, we evaluated the bounced messages feature and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts by generating a wide range of minimal code snippets. Our tests covered both standard use cases and a variety of edge and error scenarios, yielding the following key findings:

1. Standard Bounce Receiver Usage:
   • Bounce receivers declared using a custom message type (for example,
       bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
     ) compile successfully. This confirms that the basic usage adheres fully to the guidelines in the official documentation (refer to docs_book_bounced.md).

2. Invalid Receiver Declarations:
   • Bounce receivers defined with an incorrect parameter type (e.g., Int or Cell) or those declared without any parameter properly trigger clear compile-time errors. The errors enforce that only parameters of type bounced<T>, message, or Slice are permitted, precisely matching the documentation (see docs_book_contracts.md).

3. Fallback Handling:
   • Bounce receivers accepting a raw Slice (for example, bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compile without issues. This functionality provides a catch‐all mechanism for handling bounced messages, exactly as recommended.

4. State Modifications:
   • Our tests confirmed that bounce receivers are permitted to modify contract state (for instance, incrementing a counter). This is in contrast to getter functions, which are read-only, and reinforces the intended flexibility of bounce receivers.

5. Unique Receiver Enforcement:
   • Attempts to define multiple bounce receivers for the same message type result in conflict errors, ensuring a unique one-to-one handler mapping per message type.

6. Advanced Control Flow and Error Handling:
   • Incorporation of try-catch constructs (with proper syntax adjustments) within bounce receivers compiled successfully. Furthermore, recursive and cross-contract bounce handling using self.reply() and self.notify() operate as documented (see docs_book_send.md).

7. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
   • Test cases that attempted to process bounced messages beyond the 224 usable data bits limit correctly generated compile-time errors, confirming that this strict size constraint is enforced as specified.

Conclusion:
-----------
Every test, from standard valid scenarios to deliberately invalid edge cases, demonstrated that the Tact compiler’s handling of bounced messages and bounce receivers matches the official documentation. No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were observed in this feature area. 

This confirms that the bounce handling mechanism in Tact is robust and fully compliant with the specifications. Future fuzz-testing cycles will now focus on other language features.
