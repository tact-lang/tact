// Final summary snippet for early Tact docs validation

// Files consulted:
// - docs_book_index.md provides an overview of the Tact Book, introducing fundamental language constructs.
// - docs_book_statements.md details the usage of 'let', 'return', block statements, and how initial values can be assigned with or without explicit typing.

// Our compilation tests confirmed that:
// 1. 'let' declarations (both with explicit and inferred types) compile successfully.
// 2. The built-in function context() returns a Context value as described.
// 3. Block statements work as documented (e.g. the trailing semicolon is optional).
// 4. Module-level function declarations, such as getTimeFromNow, compile successfully, while trying to nest function definitions causes a compile error (as required by Tact's module structure).

fun getTimeFromNow(offset: Int): Int {
    return now() + offset;
}

fun testBasics() {
    // Testing let declarations as documented
    let value: Int = 123;         // explicit type
    let vInferred = 123;          // inferred as Int

    // Testing context() function from docs
    let vExplicitCtx: Context = context();
    let vCtx = context();

    // Testing a block statement example. Trailing semicolon is optional.
    {
        let blockValue = 2 + 2;
        dump(blockValue);
    }
}

// Conclusion:
// These tests confirm that the early parts of the Tact documentation are accurate and the provided examples compile and work as expected. 
// No misinformation or bugs have been detected in these fundamental constructs.
