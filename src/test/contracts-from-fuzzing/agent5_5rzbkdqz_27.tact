/*
Final Summary of Fuzz Testing on asm Functions:

Over the course of this extensive and systematic fuzz-testing cycle, we explored more than 50 distinct and creative test cases to evaluate the behavior of asm functions in the Tact compiler. Our tests included:

1. Basic functionality (pushing constants via PUSHINT, arithmetic operations with ADD, DUP, SWAP, and DROP) verifying correct TVM instruction consumption.

2. Parameter flattening and struct handling. We tested both simple and nested struct parameters to ensure that the flattening behavior complies with documentation. Cases where arrangements were misconfigured (e.g., duplicate entries, missing parameters, or invalid stack register indices) were correctly flagged.

3. Modifier/attribute constraints: We rigorously verified the usage and ordering of modifiers such as inline, extends, and mutates. The requirement that extension functions have the first parameter named "self" was enforced, and any deviations resulted in expected compile-time errors.

4. Complex stack operations were explored via long sequences of instructions, and error triggering (like stack underflow) occurred only at runtime as documented.

5. Contextual restrictions: As asm functions are module-level only, our tests confirmed that attempts to declare them within contracts are rejected.

6. Syntactic validations: Our tests demonstrated that orphan primitives, unknown opcodes, extraneous tokens, and misuse of casing (e.g., lowercase usage for TVM ones) yield appropriate compiler error messages.

Across these diverse test cases, every behavior aligned with the official Tact documentation (excluding the known issues already documented, such as the state modifications in getters and allowance of get attribute on assembly functions). No unexpected discrepancies or compiler bugs were discovered during this cycle.

Thus, our deep and persistent exploration confirms that the current implementation of asm functions in the Tact compiler behaves robustly and in accordance with its documented specifications.

This concludes our intensive fuzz-testing iteration for asm functions. The process remains active as we continue to explore additional compiler features in subsequent iterations.
