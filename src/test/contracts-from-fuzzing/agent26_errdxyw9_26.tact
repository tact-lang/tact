Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report: initOf Functionality and Cross-Contract Relationships

In this comprehensive testing cycle we rigorously validated the behavior of the initOf expression alongside various cross-contract relationships, as documented in the official Tact documentation (see, for example, docs_book_expressions.md and docs_ref_core-addresses.md).

Our testing strategy included: 

1. Simple cross-contract initialization (e.g., one contract obtaining the StateInit of another).
2. Multi-level hierarchical relationships using parameters (with trailing commas, as documented).
3. Complex dependency graphs where several initOf calls are composed within structs and verified via computed addresses.
4. Recursive initialization (contracts calling initOf on themselves) and circular dependencies (e.g., CircA and CircB).
5. Integration tests combining initOf with address computation functions (contractAddress, newAddress) to ensure consistency with runtime addresses (myAddress).
6. Intentional misuse and type-safety tests, which resulted in compile-time errors exactly as specified.
7. Inline function usage requiring proper self-qualification.
8. Extended tests of deep dependency graphs (DeepGraph contract) to further challenge the system.

All tests that were intended to compile did so and behaved consistently with the documented behavior. Deliberate misuses correctly raised compile-time errors. No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were found during examinations of subtle edge cases, recursive structures, or complex contract graphs.

References from the documentation were crucial for each test scenario, including:
 - The initOf documentation in the expressions section (e.g., docs_book_expressions.md),
 - Contract address computations as described in docs_ref_core-addresses.md,
 - Hierarchical contract relationships detailed in docs_book_contracts.md and related dependency diagrams.

Conclusion: The Tact compilerâ€™s handling of initOf and cross-contract interactions is robust and fully consistent with the available documentation. Thus, our exhaustive fuzz-testing cycle confirms that there is no significant discrepancy or bug in this area.
