/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
In this fuzz-testing cycle, we conducted an extensive evaluation of maps in Tact. Our approach combined readings from the official documentation (see, for example, the discussions in docs_book_maps.md   and related sections) with systematic compilation tests designed to validate every documented feature and edge case related to maps.

Key Testing Areas and Findings:
-------------------------------
1. Allowed Key Types:
   • According to the documentation, only Int and Address are permitted as keys (see docs_book_maps.md  ). We verified this by compiling valid maps such as map<Int, Int> and map<Address, Int> (e.g., TestMapValid and TestAddressKey snippets).
   • Attempts to use disallowed key types (e.g., String or a user-defined struct) were correctly rejected with clear compile‐time errors, fully enforcing the documented restriction.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   • Maps in Tact can store values of types such as Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types. Moreover, the documentation specifies that only Int types support serialization (such as using the "as uint8" modifier) to reduce storage costs (see docs_book_maps.md  ). Our tests with maps declared as map<Int as uint8, Int as uint8> confirmed the expected behavior.

3. Core Map Operations:
   • Essential operations—including insertion (.set), querying (.get and .exists), updating (.replace and .replaceGet), and deletion (.del or null assignment)—were comprehensively tested (refer to our TestMapOps and TestMapSummary snippets). In every case, behavior matched the description provided in the documentation.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration Constraints:
   • Nested maps were tested by encapsulating an inner map within a helper structure (e.g. AllowanceMap) and storing it in an outer map keyed by Address. Our tests verified that iteration using foreach only works when the map reference is a valid path expression (such as self.data), in full accordance with the documentation’s limitations stated in docs_book_statements.md  .

5. Equality Comparisons:
   • We also explored how maps are compared. The documentation distinguishes between shallow equality via the '==' operator and deep equality through the .deepEquals() method. Our tests confirmed that while shallow equality compares underlying serialized cell hashes, deepEquals performs an entry-by-entry comparison — exactly as documented.

6. Edge-Case Evaluations:
   • Additional tests with maps holding Boolean values (see our TestMapBoolFixed snippet) verified that conditional logic operates correctly even for edge cases, reinforcing that the allowed value types are implemented as specified.

Conclusion:
-----------
The diverse set of compilation tests, combined with a detailed review of the official documentation, confirmed that the current Tact compiler implements maps in complete accordance with the documented specifications. Specifically:
   • Only Int and Address are accepted as key types, with any invalid key types rejected at compile time.
   • Allowed value types, including their specialized serialization (for Int types), perform reliably.
   • Standard map operations behave exactly as described in the documentation.
   • Nested maps are supported, provided iteration is performed on valid path expressions.
   • Shallow and deep equality comparisons work in alignment with the official guidelines.

No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were observed during this thorough fuzz-testing cycle. The implementation of maps is robust and entirely consistent with the Tact documentation.
