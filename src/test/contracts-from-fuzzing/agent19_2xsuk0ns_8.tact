// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Report: initOf and Cross-Contract Relationships in Tact

/*
Overview:
This series of tests has aimed at exploring several dimensions of the Tact compiler's handling of the initOf expression, particularly in the context of cross-contract initialization and complex contract graphs. The tests were constructed in an incremental manner to cover various documented scenarios:

1. Simple cross-contract initialization: In contract A, the initOf expression is used to obtain the StateInit (i.e. initial state package) of contract B. This verifies that referencing another contract’s state works as expected.

2. Multi-level hierarchical initialization: A test involving three contracts (A, B, and C) arranged in a parent-child chain was compiled, verifying that nested initOf expressions (A -> B, B -> C) are handled correctly.

3. Recursive initialization: A contract called Recursive uses initOf on itself. This scenario confirms that the compiler allows self-referencing initialization for non-runtime purposes without infinite recursion.

4. Mutual dependency: Two contracts (A and B) each reference initOf of the other. The mutual dependency test confirms that the compiler’s dependency analysis and delayed initialization for getter functions work consistently.

5. Use with contract parameters: A contract employing contract parameters (implicit init) required accessing fields via self (e.g. self.a, self.b), highlighting the necessity of proper field referencing as stated in the documentation.

6. Address consistency check: Using initOf in conjunction with contractAddress achieves a consistent address with myAddress(), aligning with the documented behavior that both reflect the same initial state for the current contract.

All our tests compiled successfully (with the expected compile-time error in Test 5 before correction), showing that the Tact compiler adheres to documented behaviors regarding initOf. None of the tests produced unexpected errors or internal compiler errors. The results confirm that the compiler both supports simple and complex usages of initOf, including nested graphs, recursive and mutually dependent initializations.

Conclusion:
Our investigation has not revealed any discrepancies between the Tact compiler's behavior and the official documentation regarding initOf and cross-contract relationships. The tested scenarios align with the intended functionalities as documented (see docs at /book/expressions#initof and related sections). Further fuzz-testing iterations could explore even more elaborate graph configurations, but based on the current tests, the compiler demonstrates robust handling of these scenarios.
