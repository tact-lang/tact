    dump("Fuzz Testing Process Update:\n\nOur comprehensive fuzz testing cycle for the Tact compiler has now encompassed many features. In our cycles we have tested:\n\n- Maps and Dictionaries: Verifying basic operations (insertion, deletion, iteration), advanced functions (replace, replaceGet, deepEquals), serialization constraints (only fixed-width serialization for keys), and the nested map syntax quirk (where writing nested types requires a space between consecutive closing angle brackets, e.g. \"map<Int, map<Int, Int> >\"). For details, see documentation in docs_book_maps.md (citeturn0file0) and examples in docs_book_statements.md (citeturn0file1).\n\n- Bitwise Operators: Standard bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and shift operations performed as expected on 257-bit signed integers (see docs_book_operators.md, citeturn0file4).\n\n- Structs and Messages: Our tests confirmed that struct initialization, nested struct composition, destructuring (field punning and discarding using underscore), and the use of maps as struct fields all function per the documentation (refer to docs_book_maps.md and docs_book_statements.md, citeturn0file9).\n\n- Error Handling: Try-catch constructs reliably capture errors such as cell underflow (exit code 9).\n\n- Contract State Variables and Getter Behavior: We validated the persistence of state updates in non-getter functions versus the ephemeral modifications in getter functions, in line with documentation clarification (see https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#getter-functions).\n\n- Optionals and Null Handling: Tests using optionals confirmed that null comparisons, non-null assertions, and helper functions (like safeAdd) yield correct results.\n\n- Message Receiver Behavior: Contracts with specific (tagged) and fallback receive handlers compile and are defined as expected.\n\nAll these aspects were rigorously fuzz-tested, and every tested feature behaves as the official documentation states. The only subtle nuance noted is the requirement for an extra space in nested generic type declarations for maps, which is an expected parser behavior rather than a bug.\n\nContinuing our systematic exploration, we now move on to testing further Tact compiler features with the same depth and rigor. No significant issues were detected.\n\nFinal status: All tested features conform to the official documentation.\n\nFurther documentation and examples can be found in the uploaded files."
