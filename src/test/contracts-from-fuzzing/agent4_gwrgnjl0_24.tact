Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
This comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle has focused on examining the Tact implementation, documentation, and behavior of maps. We concentrated our testing efforts on key and value types, serialization options, core operations (insertion, deletion, updating, querying), nested map usages, and equality comparisons—all while validating that the Tact compiler enforces the constraints described in the official documentation.

Documentation Context:
----------------------
• The official maps documentation (see  ) stipulates that allowed key types are restricted exclusively to Int and Address, while allowed value types include Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types (structs or messages) under valid contexts. Specifically, only Int keys support serialization formats (for example, Int as uint8 as seen in  ).

• Map operations such as .set(), .get(), .exists(), .replace(), .replaceGet(), and .del() are documented to work with predictable semantics (refer to  ,  ,  ). Equality comparisons using the shallow equality operator (==) rely on comparing the underlying cell hashes, whereas the .deepEquals() function conducts an entry-by-entry comparison (see   and  ).

Test Summary:
-------------
1. Allowed Key Types:
   - Valid key types—maps declared with key type Int (TestMapValid) and Address (TestAddressKey) compile and behave as expected.
   - Attempts to declare maps with disallowed key types such as String (TestInvalidKey) or user-defined struct keys (TestStructKey) correctly trigger compile-time errors, affirming adherence to the documentation.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   - Maps with value types including Int, Bool, and even serialized versions (e.g. Int as uint8 in TestSerializedMap) work correctly, confirming that serialization is applicable only to the Int key/value combination as documented.

3. Core Map Operations:
   - Basic operations including insertion (.set), querying (.get and .exists), updating (.replace and .replaceGet), and deletion (.del or by assigning null) have been systematically tested (see TestMapOps and TestMapSummary). These tests returned expected results with appropriate boolean values and updated state.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration Constraints:
   - We successfully implemented nested maps by wrapping an inner map in a struct (AllowanceMap) and storing it within an outer map keyed by Address. Iteration using the foreach construct behaves correctly when the map is referenced via a valid path expression (self.data), while attempts to iterate over maps produced from function calls yield proper errors. This behavior aligns with the documented constraints (see  ).

5. Equality Comparisons:
   - Shallow equality (==) compares maps based on their underlying serialized cell hashes, while .deepEquals() does a thorough entry comparison. Tests (TestMapDeepEquals) confirmed that these distinctions hold true, especially when alterations by replacement produce the expected differences in equality results.

6. Boolean Map Values:
   - A map using Bool as its value type (TestMapBoolFixed) was successfully compiled and executed once syntax was adjusted, verifying that Bool is a permitted type according to the documentation.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our fuzz-testing cycle has demonstrated that the Tact compiler enforces all documented constraints on maps:
   • Key types are strictly limited to Int and Address, and any deviation (e.g. using String or Struct types) is rejected at compile time.
   • Allowed value types (including support for serialization with Int) function as expected.
   • All map operations (.set, .get, .exists, .replace, .replaceGet, and .del) work reliably in accordance with the official documentation.
   • Nested map handling and iteration restrictions are applied as documented.
   • The distinction between shallow equality (==) and deep equality (.deepEquals()) is maintained.

No discrepancies, unexpected behavior, or compiler bugs were observed during our extensive testing. All observed behaviors match the official Tact documentation [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ].
