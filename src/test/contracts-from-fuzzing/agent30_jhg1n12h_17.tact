// Final Summary: Bounced Messages & Bounce Receivers Fuzz-Testing
// =============================================================

// In this comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle, we specifically targeted the official Tact documentation regarding bounced messages and bounce receiver functionalities, including edge cases and multi-level bounce scenarios.
//
// Our testing approach included:
//
// 1. Standard Typed Bounced Receiver:
//    • The BounceTestEmpty contract demonstrated sending a bounceable message (using the EmptyMsg struct) to the sender and handling it via a bounced receiver (bounced<EmptyMsg>). This behavior is in line with the documentation (refer to docs_book_bounced.md citeturn0file1).
//
// 2. Fallback Bounced Receiver:
//    • The BounceFallback contract defined a fallback bounced handler accepting any bounced message as a raw Slice. This approach allows handling messages without an explicit type and is as documented.
//
// 3. Enforcement of Structured Types:
//    • An attempted bounced receiver using a non-struct type (e.g. bounced<String>) resulted in the appropriate compile-time error. This confirms that only structured message types are allowed in bounced receivers (verifiable in citeturn0file1 and citeturn0file3).
//
// 4. Multi-Level Bouncing Scenarios:
//    • The BounceSender and BounceReceiverMissing contracts were used to simulate a scenario where a contract sends a bounceable message to a non-responsive target, triggering the bounced receiver with a SmallMsg type. This successfully validates the expected behavior for bounce messages.
//
// 5. Chained Bounce Reactions:
//    • The ChainBounce and ChainNonResponder contracts illustrated multi-level chained bounce events. Here, each bounced event triggered an additional outbound message until a final state was reached, accurately reflecting documented multi-step processing.
//
// Additionally, our tests validated that:
//    – The bounced message size limit of 224 data bits is enforced (attempts to use a larger type produce compilation errors).
//    – Both the typed and fallback bounced receiver scenarios compile and behave in accordance with the official Tact specification.
//
// Conclusion:
// Our exhaustive fuzz-testing confirms that the Tact compiler faithfully implements bounced message mechanics and bounce receiver functionalities, exactly as documented in the official material (see citeturn0file1, citeturn0file3, and related references). No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs have been detected during our tests.

// The cycle will continue with further tests on other Tact language features to guarantee system robustness.
