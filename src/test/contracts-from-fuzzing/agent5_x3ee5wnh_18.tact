// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report
//
// Introduction:
// As part of our deep examination of the Tact documentation, we selected an arbitrary section covering a diverse mix of language features including try-catch blocks, conditional statements (if/else and ternary), assembly functions, and getter functions. Over the course of the testing cycle, we compiled many minimal, representative code snippets to verify conformance with the documentation and to explore edge cases.
//
// Test Categories and Observations:
//
// 1. Try-Catch Constructs:
//    - We started with simple try-catch blocks to ensure errors thrown via throw(â€¦) are properly handled. 
//    - Our tests verified that the try block stops execution upon throw and that the catch block correctly receives the error value for processing. 
//    - In nested try-catch tests, we observed that unreachable code warnings are raised when statements are placed after throw, which aligns with compiler expectations.
//
// 2. Conditional Constructs:
//    - Our tests using if-else ladders and ternary operators confirmed that these constructs evaluate conditions correctly, returning the expected values based on the input.
//
// 3. Assembly Functions:
//    - We compiled an assembly function invoking the DEPTH instruction. The function compiled and executed as expected, verifying that the mechanism for reading the stack depth works in practice.
//
// 4. Getter Functions and State Modifications:
//    - Despite the documentation recommending that getters only read state (and not modify it), our tests intentionally modified a state variable within a getter. The compiler accepted this behavior, and at runtime, the state variable was updated, even though such modifications do not persist beyond the current TVM execution. This confirms that the documented restriction is not enforced for runtime execution, which matches known clarifications of behavior.
//
// 5. Combined and Nested Constructs:
//    - We combined try-catch with conditionals to create more complex control flow. Although certain configurations led to unreachable code errors (as expected due to throw-catch semantics), properly structured code snippets compiled successfully and behaved as expected at runtime.
//
// Summary:
// Throughout this fuzz-testing cycle, our extensive testing did not reveal any previously unreported compiler bugs or deviations from (updated) specifications in undocumented areas. The unreachable code checks and error messages are as expected, and even edge cases such as state modifications within getters behave consistently with our runtime observations.
//
// Conclusion:
// Our fuzz-testing cycle confirms that the Tact compiler behavior is largely consistent with the documentation (with noted clarifications regarding runtime state modifications in getters). No new significant bugs or mismatches were observed during this cycle.
//
// This report serves as a summary of our rigorous tests as we continue exploring additional aspects of the Tact language in subsequent cycles.
