// Summary snippet (for human reference only, not to be deployed on-chain)
// The following summary explains the results of our extensive testing of the initOf functionality and cross-contract relationships in Tact.

/*
Our fuzz-testing cycle covered various scenarios related to initOf and cross-contract relationships as follows:

1. Simple Cross-Contract Initialization:
   - A contract (SimpleChild) was deployed using initOf from a parent contract (SimpleParent) to obtain its StateInit.
   - The computed contractAddress was derived from the StateInit, compiling successfully as expected.

2. Multi-level Parent-Child Relationships:
   - A deeper contract hierarchy (GrandChild -> Child -> Parent) was constructed.
   - Each level used initOf to obtain the next contract's initial state and computed its address via contractAddress, with all snippets compiling cleanly.

3. Recursive Initialization:
   - A contract (Recursive) used initOf on itself. The snippet compiled without errors, demonstrating that recursive self-initialization is supported by the compiler.

4. Mutual Recursive Initialization:
   - Two contracts (A and B) invoked initOf on each other. Both contracts compiled successfully, indicating that the circular references resolve as per current compiler behavior.

5. Deep Nested Contract Graph:
   - A highly nested chain (Level0 → Level1 → Level2 → Level3 → Level4) was constructed.
   - Each contract used initOf for the child contract, and all levels compiled successfully without any issues, affirming that complex nested structures work as intended.

6. Parameterized Contracts:
   - A parameterized contract (ParamContract) was tested with different initialization parameters via initOf in both its own receiver and from another contract (TestParam).
   - The contracts compiled correctly, confirming that the use of contract parameters with initOf aligns with the documentation.

Overall, each representative minimal code snippet compiled successfully with the Tact compiler. The behavior of initOf, contractAddress, and the cross-contract relationships supports the documented behavior as found in the Tact documentation (e.g., see sections on initOf and contractAddress in docs_book_expressions.md   and docs_ref_core-addresses.md  ).

These tests cover a range of scenarios including simple, multi-level, recursive, mutual recursive, deeply nested and parameterized contract initializations. No unexpected behavior or discrepancies were observed in any of the tests.

This comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle indicates that the current implementation of initOf and cross-contract relationships in Tact conforms to the documented specifications.
