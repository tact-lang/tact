// Comprehensive Final Answer: Fuzz-Testing of Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact

/*
Final Summary:
-------------
Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle on bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts confirms that the Tact compiler behaves precisely according to the official documentation. Key findings include:

1. Standard Usage:
   • Bounce receiver functions declared with a custom message type (e.g., using:
         bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
     ) compile without issue, validating the intended and documented usage (see docs_book_bounced.md).

2. Invalid Declarations:
   • Bounce receivers defined with an improper parameter type (such as Int or Cell) or those declared with no parameter produce clear compile-time errors. The compiler enforces that only parameters of type bounced<T>, a message type, or Slice are allowed, as documented in docs_book_contracts.md.

3. Fallback Handling:
   • Bounce receivers that capture all bounced messages via a Slice parameter (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compile successfully, providing a catch-all mechanism exactly as recommended in the docs.

4. State Modifications:
   • Bounce receivers can modify the contract state (for example, by incrementing a counter). This behavior differentiates bounce receivers from getter functions (which cannot modify state) and is consistent with the documentation in docs_book_contracts.md.

5. Unique Receiver Enforcement:
   • Attempts to define multiple bounce receivers for the same message type correctly trigger a conflict error, guaranteeing a unique handler per message type.

6. Advanced Control Flow:
   • Incorporating try-catch blocks (with correct syntax) within bounce receivers, as well as recursive or cross-contract interactions (using self.reply() and self.notify()), compile and function as expected. This confirms that advanced error handling and messaging patterns behave as prescribed (see docs_book_send.md).

7. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
   • Tests that attempt to process bounced messages exceeding the 224 usable data bits limit result in compile-time errors, confirming that the compiler strictly enforces this constraint in line with the documented limitations.

Conclusion:
-----------
All tests—from standard valid uses to edge-case and invalid example scenarios—indicate that the behavior of bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact is robust and in exact accordance with the official documentation. No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were detected. This confirms that the bounce handling mechanisms in the Tact compiler are implemented correctly and reliably.

For further details, consult the following documentation sections:
   • Bounced messages: docs_book_bounced.md  
   • Contract receiver guidelines and state modifications: docs_book_contracts.md  
   • Messaging and outbound behavior (self.reply, self.notify): docs_book_send.md  

This fuzz-testing cycle is thus complete with all results adhering to expectations, and further fuzz-testing will continue to explore other Tact language features.
