// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Summary for Bounced Messages and Bounce Receivers in Tact Contracts

/*
FINAL SUMMARY:
--------------
Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle for bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact contracts confirms that the current implementation adheres strictly to the official documentation.

Key Findings:
-------------
1. According to the documentation (docs_book_bounced.md citeturn0file0 and docs_book_contracts.md citeturn0file9), when a message is sent with the bounce flag set to true and fails to execute correctly, it bounces back to the sender. Contracts are expected to handle these bounced messages with a dedicated bounce receiver using either a typed parameter (bounced(msg: bounced<T>)) or a raw parameter (bounced(rawMsg: Slice)).

2. Our tests confirmed that:
   • Valid implementations of bounce receivers, both typed (e.g., ValidBounceTyped using bounced(msg: bounced<BounceMsg>)) and raw (e.g., ValidBounceRaw using bounced(rawMsg: Slice)), compile successfully.
   • The compiler correctly enforces that a bounce receiver must declare exactly one parameter. Attempts to define duplicate bounce receivers or to use an invalid parameter type (or omit the parameter altogether) result in clear compile-time errors.
   • In multi-contract scenarios, a CallerChain contract sending a message (with bounce enabled) to a ReceiverChain contract that deliberately fails (via require(false, ...)) leads to the bounce receiver in CallerChain capturing the bounced message, as intended.
   • Using underscore notation for an unused bounce receiver parameter (e.g., bounced(_msg: bounced<BounceMsg>)) is accepted.

3. Overall, all behaviors observed during our fuzz-testing conform to the documented semantics. No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were identified.

Conclusion:
-----------
The Tact compiler’s behavior regarding bounced messages and bounce receivers is robust and consistent with the official documentation. Our testing confirms that valid bounce receiver definitions compile and function as intended, while invalid definitions are reliably rejected. The multi-contract bounce propagation mechanism works as expected.

This comprehensive validation demonstrates that bounced message handling in Tact is implemented exactly as documented.
