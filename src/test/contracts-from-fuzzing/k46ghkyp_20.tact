// Final Summary of Investigation

/*
Our investigation into the earliest parts of the Tact documentation began by reviewing materials from the Tact Book, specifically the introductory sections found in docs_book_index.md and the detailed examples from docs_book_statements.md.

Key points from the documentation include:
  • The 'let' statement for variable declarations works as described, with both explicit types (e.g., let value: Int = 123) and type inference (e.g., let vInferred = 123).
  • The built-in function context() correctly returns a Context, a built-in structure, as demonstrated in the docs.
  • Block statements encapsulate multiple statements and allow the final semicolon to be optional.
  • Top-level Tact code is structured as functions, so module-level variable declarations outside functions are disallowed (which matches the documented design).

We have validated these constructs by compiling multiple test snippets:
  • Declaring and initializing variables using 'let' works correctly.
  • Fetching a Context using context() compiles without errors.
  • Block statements group operations as shown.
  • Top-level functions (e.g., getTimeFromNow) compile as expected.

Therefore, our experiments confirm that the foundational constructs described in these early sections of the Tact documentation are accurate and behave as documented. No discrepancies or misinformation have been found in these parts of the docs.

Citations:
  • docs_book_index.md – Overview of the Tact book and its contents
  • docs_book_statements.md – Detailed explanation of 'let' statements, block syntax, and contextual functions like context()

Conclusion: The early Tact documentation examples compile and work as expected, confirming their accuracy.

fun getTimeFromNow(offset: Int): Int {
    return now() + offset;
}

fun testBasics() {
    // Test explicit and inferred 'let' declarations
    let value: Int = 123;
    let vInferred = 123;

    // Test context() functionality
    let vExplicitCtx: Context = context();
    let vCtx = context();

    // Test block statement with optional trailing semicolon
    {
        let blockValue = 2 + 2;
        dump(blockValue);
    }
}
