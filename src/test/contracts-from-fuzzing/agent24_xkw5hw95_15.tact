// Final summary code: Bounce receivers behave as documented

/*
Based on comprehensive fuzz-testing, the bounce receiver functionality in Tact is fully consistent with the official documentation:

1. Bounce receiver definitions using the typed syntax (e.g., bounced(msg: bounced<BounceMsg>)) compile successfully, and the compiler enforces that exactly one parameter must be declared. This behavior is in line with the documentation (as seen in docs_book_bounced.md citeturn0file0 and docs_book_contracts.md citeturn0file9).

2. Bounce receivers can alternatively be declared using a raw Slice parameter (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)), which also compiles without issues.

3. Edge cases produce appropriate compile-time errors:
   - Duplicate bounce receivers in a single contract cause a compilation error.
   - Bounce receivers with missing parameters or parameters of an invalid type are correctly rejected by the compiler.

4. Multi-contract testing (the chain bounce scenario) confirms that a contract sending a message with bounce enabled will receive a bounced message via its bounce receiver if the target contract fails as expected. This is consistent with the mechanism described in the documentation.

5. The underscore naming convention (e.g., bounced(_msg: bounced<BounceMsg>)) for unused parameters is accepted by the compiler as expected.

In summary, our tests have not revealed any discrepancies or bugs; the behavior of bounce receivers matches the documented behavior in Tact.
