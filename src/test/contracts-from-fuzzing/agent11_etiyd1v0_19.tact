/*
Summary and Next Steps in the Fuzz-Testing Cycle:

Our extensive and systematic fuzz-testing of map (dictionary) features in Tact has confirmed that the compiler's behavior is in full agreement with the official documentation. Our tests covered:

• Allowed key/value types and serialization – only Int and Address are allowed as keys, with serialization modifiers applicable to Int keys, while values support additional types such as Bool, Cell, Struct, and Message.

• Core map operations such as insertion, retrieval, replacement (with replace() and replaceGet()), and deletion (both via del() and null assignment) – all functions performed as documented.

• Equality checks – shallow equality (==) depends on underlying cell serialization order while deepEquals() correctly compares map entries irrespective of insertion order.

• Iteration restrictions and edge cases – including the requirement that foreach operates only on path expressions (identifiers or direct member accesses) and that modification during iteration is subject to careful handling.

• Handling of arithmetic expressions as keys and nested maps – these behaved consistently with Tact’s integer arithmetic rules and allowed nested structure semantics.

Throughout this dedicated cycle we encountered all expected behaviors and appropriate error messages (e.g., when disallowed key types were used or improper iteration targets were provided). No significant compiler bug or documentation mismatch has been detected.

With the map component now thoroughly validated, we will continue our fuzz-testing process by moving on to other compiler features in a similarly comprehensive manner. The next cycle of tests will be directed toward exploring other advanced Tact language features, such as assembly functions, contract state modifications in getter functions, and potential edge cases in other composite types.
