// Summary of Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle (Continued)
//
// In this extended testing cycle, we have rigorously exercised the initOf functionality and related cross-contract interactions covering a wide range of scenarios:
//
// 1. Simple cross-contract initialization (contract A & B), multi-level parent-child and grandchild usage, and even combined dependencies using structs (CombinedDeps).
//
// 2. Recursive initialization testing through contracts such as Recursion and RecursiveGetter, confirming that the inline and self-referential use of initOf does not lead to unexpected behavior.
//
// 3. Circular dependency patterns (CircA and CircB) that, while not recommended in production, compile without internal compiler errors, thus matching documentation's claim that initOf only computes a StateInit without runtime evaluation of side effects.
//
// 4. Parameter handling, including trailing commas and enforcing correct argument types (the intentional misuse in WrongType produced a compile-time error as expected).
//
// 5. Integration with functions computing contract addresses (via contractAddress) verified that the computed address based on the init package matches runtime addresses where applicable (as seen in GetInit, InlineInit, and FinalTest).
//
// 6. Additional tests, such as the Complex and TestComplex contracts, confirmed that passing multiple parameters—and creating a valid Address using newAddress(0, 0)—behaves as specified by the documentation (see docs_book_expressions.md and docs_ref_core-addresses.md    ).
//
// 7. Tests enforcing type safety (e.g., passing a String to an Int parameter) correctly result in compile-time errors.
//
// 8. Inlining of functions using initOf (as in InlineInit) correctly required the self-qualification, and its behavior is consistent with expectations.
//
// Across all these scenarios, every observed behavior confirms the documentation: the initOf expression behaves as documented in computing the initial state (StateInit) of a contract, and the contractAddress function reliably computes the contract address from this state.
//
// No significant discrepancies or unexpected compiler behaviors have been found in our comprehensive tests. All compile-time errors encountered were consistent with intentional misuse or documented restrictions.
//
// We will persist in our rigorous exploration of other Tact features, probing edge cases further. However, regarding the initOf functionality and cross-contract relationships, our extensive tests confirm that the compiler behaves according to the official sources, with no detected deviations.
//
// End of current fuzz-testing cycle for initOf and cross-contract interactions.
