Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
This fuzz-testing cycle rigorously examined the implementation, documentation, and behavior of maps in Tact by focusing on key and value types, core operations, serialization behavior, nested maps, iteration rules, and equality comparisons. Our tests were designed to validate every claim made in the official Tact documentation [ ,  ].

Key Testing Areas and Findings:
-------------------------------
1. Allowed Key Types:
   • Documentation specifies that only Int and Address are allowed as map keys [ ]. Our tests confirmed that maps declared as map<Int, Int> or map<Address, Int> compile and work as expected. 
   • Attempts to use disallowed key types (e.g. String in TestInvalidKey or user-defined structs in TestStructKey) correctly trigger compile-time errors, perfectly aligning with the official guidelines.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   • Allowed value types include Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types. Additionally, while serialization formats (e.g. "as uint8") are available for Int types [ ], no other key or value types support this feature. Our tests with serialized maps (e.g. TestSerializedMap) demonstrated that the expected serialization behavior is fully enforced.

3. Core Map Operations:
   • Map operations such as insertion (.set), querying (.get and .exists), replacement (.replace and .replaceGet), and deletion (.del or setting to null) behaved consistently as documented [ ,  ]. For example, replacing an entry returned the prescribed boolean or old value, and deletion operations removed keys correctly.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration Behavior:
   • Tests involving nested maps (e.g. embedding an inner map in a struct such as AllowanceMap and inserting into an outer map keyed by Address) have confirmed that while nested maps work as expected, iteration over maps is only permitted via proper path expressions (such as self.data), as noted in the documentation [ ]. Attempting iteration over maps created from function calls produces appropriate compilation errors.

5. Equality Comparisons:
   • Our tests demonstrated that shallow equality (using the '==' operator) compares maps based on their underlying serialized cell hashes, while deep equality (.deepEquals) performs an entry-by-entry comparison. This behavior is in exact agreement with what the documentation describes [ ].

6. Boolean Values in Maps:
   • Maps storing Bool values correctly compile and function when integrated with conditional logic, verifying that Bool is a supported map value type.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle has verified that the Tact compiler strictly enforces the documented behavior for maps: key type restrictions are adhered to (only Int and Address are allowed), map operations behave as expected, serialization is correctly applied for Int types, nested maps function with proper iteration constraints, and equality operators distinguish correctly between shallow and deep comparisons. No discrepancies or compiler bugs were detected.

Overall Result: All map-related tests passed successfully.
