Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report: initOf Functionality and Cross-Contract Relationships

Overview:
------------
In this comprehensive testing cycle, we rigorously exercised the Tact compiler’s handling of the initOf expression and its interplay with cross-contract relationships. Our test suite spanned numerous scenarios, including:

1. Simple cross-contract initialization (e.g., Contract A and B) to retrieve StateInit structures.
2. Multi-level hierarchical relationships using initOf with parameters – confirming proper argument passing, including use of trailing commas (see docs_book_expressions.md and docs_book_contracts.md).
3. Complex dependency graphs that combine multiple initOf calls into structured results (e.g., CombinedDeps, DeepGraph), with subsequent address computation verifying consistency between computed addresses (via contractAddress/newAddress) and runtime addresses (myAddress()).
4. Recursive initialization schemes (Recursion, RecursiveGetter) and circular dependencies (CircA/CircB) that compile without internal errors, in line with documentation.
5. Type-safety: deliberate misuse (e.g., passing a String instead of an Int) produced compile-time errors as expected.
6. Correct inline function usage requiring self-qualification (as shown in InlineInit).

Key Observations:
------------------
• Every test snippet that was intended to compile did so successfully, producing valid StateInit outputs and integrating seamlessly with address computations. 
• Intentional misusages produced precise compile-time errors, validating Tact’s static type checking. 
• No unexpected runtime errors or internal compiler malfunctions were encountered in any configuration.

Documentation Cross-References:
-------------------------------
Our tests corroborated the documented behavior in key sections, including:
  - The initOf expression as elaborated in docs_book_expressions.md
  - Cross-contract address computation as described in docs_ref_core-addresses.md
  - Contract parameter and dependency handling detailed in docs_book_contracts.md

Conclusion:
-----------
After an exhaustive and systematic exploration of the initOf functionality and its associated cross-contract relationship mechanisms, no discrepancies or unexpected behaviors have been identified. The Tact compiler’s behavior is in full agreement with the official documentation. 

Future Work:
------------
While our current cycle focused exclusively on initOf and its dependencies, the fuzz-testing process will persist in exploring further compiler features and edge cases. In this cycle, however, all tests confirm that the implementation conforms to documented expectations.
