/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
In this fuzz-testing cycle, we performed an intensive evaluation of Tact maps. Our tests targeted the following aspects:

1. Allowed Key Types: 
   - Only Int and Address are permitted as key types, as clearly stated in the official documentation (see docs_book_maps.md  ). 
   - Our tests confirmed that maps declared with key types Int (e.g. map<Int, Int>) or Address (e.g. map<Address, Int>) compile and function correctly, whereas attempts to use disallowed types (e.g. String or user-defined structs) trigger compile-time errors.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   - Permitted value types include Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types. Additionally, only Int keys and values support serialization (e.g. using the 'as uint8' modifier), which is documented in the maps section (docs_book_maps.md  ).
   - Test cases using serialized maps (e.g. map<Int as uint8, Int as uint8>) behave as expected without issues.

3. Core Map Operations:
   - Operations such as insertion (.set), querying (.get, .exists), replacement (.replace, .replaceGet), and deletion (.del) were systematically tested. The behavior observed aligns with the documentation examples provided (see docs_book_maps.md   and  ).
   - For instance, replacing a value returns the proper boolean flag or the previous value, and setting an entry to null effectively deletes it.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration Constraints:
   - We implemented nested maps by encapsulating an inner map within a struct (e.g. AllowanceMap) and then storing it in an outer map keyed by Address. Iteration via the foreach construct was successfully tested on valid path expressions (e.g. self.data) and was correctly rejected for non-path expressions, exactly as described in the documentation (see docs_book_statements.md  ).

5. Equality Comparisons:
   - Our tests highlight the important distinction between shallow equality (using the '==' operator, which compares underlying cell hashes) and deep equality (using the .deepEquals() function, which performs an entry-by-entry comparison). Both methods behave as documented (refer to docs_book_maps.md  ).

6. Edge Cases – Boolean Values:
   - Maps that store Boolean values compile and operate correctly when used with conditionals (after minor syntactic adjustments), confirming that Bool is a valid map value type.

Conclusion:
-----------
All extensive tests and edge-case explorations confirm that the Tact compiler implements maps exactly as specified in the official documentation. The following key points were validated:
   • Only Int and Address are allowed as keys.
   • Allowed value types, including their serialization options, behave reliably.
   • The core operations (.set, .get, .exists, .replace, .replaceGet, .del) function as documented.
   • Nested maps and iteration restrictions are properly enforced.
   • Equality comparisons differentiate between shallow and deep methods.

No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were detected in our fuzz-testing cycle. The implementation of maps in Tact is robust and aligns perfectly with the documented specifications.
