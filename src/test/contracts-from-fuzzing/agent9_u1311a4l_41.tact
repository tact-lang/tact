// Summary Report: Fuzz-Testing Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact

/*
Final Summary:
-------------
Our exhaustive fuzz-testing cycle on bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts has verified that the Tact compiler behaves exactly as specified in the official documentation. Our testing approach included the following:

1. Standard Bounce Receiver Usage:
   - Bounce receivers declared with a custom message type (e.g., bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>)) compiled successfully, validating the documented syntax (see docs_book_bounced.md).

2. Invalid Declarations:
   - Bounce receivers with invalid parameter types (e.g., Int or Cell) or those declared without parameters triggered clear compile-time errors, enforcing that only bounced<T>, message, or Slice types are allowed (as outlined in docs_book_contracts.md).

3. Fallback Handling:
   - A fallback bounce receiver declared as bounced(rawMsg: Slice) compiled without issue, allowing the contract to capture all bounced messages.

4. State Modifications:
   - Bounce receiver tests confirmed that state updates (such as incrementing a counter) are permitted, contrasting with restrictions on getter functions.

5. Receiver Conflict Prevention:
   - Attempts to declare multiple bounce receivers for the same message type resulted in conflict errors, ensuring a one-to-one mapping which prevents ambiguity.

6. Advanced Control Flow:
   - Incorporation of try-catch (with correct syntax) and recursive/cross-contract bounce handling (using self.reply() or self.notify()) compiled and performed as expected, confirming the robustness of error handling mechanisms.

7. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
   - Tests that attempted to exceed the 224 usable data bits limit produced appropriate compile-time errors, confirming strict enforcement of the limit.

Conclusion:
-----------
All test cases—from standard valid usage to aggressive edge cases and error conditions—demonstrate that the Tact compiler's implementation of bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality adheres strictly to the official specifications. No discrepancies, bugs, or undocumented behavior was observed.

This fuzz-testing cycle for bounced messages is therefore considered successful, and further tests will continue addressing additional features.
