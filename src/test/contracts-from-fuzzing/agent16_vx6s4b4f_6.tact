// Fuzz Testing Cycle Summary for initOf Functionality and Cross-Contract Relationships
//
// This series of Tact code snippets has been compiled to probe various scenarios mentioned in the documentation regarding the
// initOf expression and its usage in cross-contract initialization as well as complex contract graphs.
//
// The tests included:
//
// 1. Simple cross-contract initialization (contract B initializing contract A).
//
// 2. Multi-level parent-child relationships: "Grandparent -> Parent -> Child".
//
// 3. Recursive self-initialization (SelfRef contract initializing itself).
//
// 4. Cross-contract cyclic dependencies (CrossCycleA <-> CrossCycleB).
//
// 5. Contract with parameters and trailing commas (Param contract).
//
// 6. Initialization used in computing self-address (F contract using contractAddress(initOf F())).
//
// 7. Multiple independent initializations in one contract (Root contract initializing A, Param, and C).
//
// 8. Conditional branching with initOf usage (ConditionalInit contract).
//
// All these tests compiled successfully, demonstrating that the current implementation of initOf and handling of cross-contract
// relationships is aligned with the documented behavior. Specifically:
//
// - Trailing commas in parameter lists are allowed as documented.
// - Multi-level and cyclic initializations compile without unexpected errors (though caution is needed at runtime for cyclic graphs).
// - Using initOf to compute a contract's address via contractAddress(initOf ...) produces deterministic results as expected.
//
// Documentation references:
// • The initOf expression and its syntax, see docs_book_expressions.md   and related sections.
// • Cross-contract relationships and contractAddressExt usage are described in docs_ref_core-addresses.md  .
//
// Conclusion:
// The observed compiler behavior for initOf and cross-contract relationships is consistent with the official documentation.
// No discrepancies or unintended side-effects have been found in these edge cases. The fuzzer will continue to the next feature.
