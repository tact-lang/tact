// Fuzz Testing Summary for initOf Functionality and Cross-contract Relationships in Tact
//
// Our comprehensive fuzz testing cycle focused on the 'initOf' expression and related cross-contract functionality in Tact.
// We extensively reviewed the documentation (see   for initOf) and implemented a series of minimal code snippets covering various scenarios:
//
// 1. Simple Cross-Contract Initialization:
//    - A contract A uses initOf to obtain the initial state package (StateInit) of contract B by correctly passing the required argument(s).
//    - Compilation was successful, confirming that the expression returns the expected StateInit. (✓)
//
// 2. Hierarchical and Multi-level Parent-Child Relationships:
//    - We set up several contracts (e.g., A2, B2, C) where one contract’s functions use initOf on another, and even computed addresses using contractAddress(initOf ...).
//    - The tests confirmed that contracts with multiple levels of dependencies (e.g., Parent initializing Child and GrandChild) compile successfully. (✓)
//
// 3. Recursive / Circular Initialization:
//    - We created a recursive dependency scenario where contract D calls initOf E and vice versa.
//    - The compiler handled such circular references as these are used solely to compute initial state packages, conforming with the documentation. (✓)
//
// 4. Error Conditions:
//    - We attempted to invoke initOf on a contract (Faulty) without providing its required argument. As expected, the compiler produced an error message indicating the incorrect number of arguments. (✓)
//
// 5. Complex Contract Graphs:
//    - We combined various scenarios by constructing complex graphs where contracts call initOf on other contracts and even use trailing commas in argument lists.
//    - All such tests compiled correctly, verifying that trailing commas are accepted and that multi-graph dependencies are resolved at compile time. (✓)
//
// Our tests validate documented claims, as outlined in sections such as the documentation on initOf in   and cross-contract address computations in   and  .
// No discrepancies were found between the official documentation and the compiler’s behavior for the initOf functionality and its usage in cross-contract relationships.
//
// In summary, the Tact compiler robustly supports diverse and intricate scenarios for contract initialization as documented. Our testing shows that:
//   • Simple and nested initOf calls work as expected.
//   • Recursive dependencies compile without issue.
//   • Compiler errors properly occur when initOf is misused (e.g., wrong parameter count).
