// Summary contract to encapsulate results from map fuzz testing

// Note: This contract is not meant to be deployed, but rather serves as a summary of our testing cycle
// and our observations regarding the Tact map implementation vs. the documentation.

// Observations:
// 1. Allowed types: Only Int and Address are allowed as key types, and allowed value types include Int, Bool, Cell, Address, Struct, and Message.
//    --> Our tests using invalid key types (Bool) and invalid value types (String) produce compile errors, confirming this restriction [ ].

// 2. Standard map operations like set, replace, replaceGet (with deletion semantics when using null), exists, deepEquals, and asCell behave exactly as documented.
//    --> For example, replaceGet returns the old value and deletes an entry when null is passed. Both tests compile and produce expected results.

// 3. Serialization: Using serialization annotations (e.g., Int as uint8) works fine for maps. However, the documentation notes that only fixed-width serialization formats are allowed
//    for key types, and that variable-length types are not permitted. Our test case for variable integer types on keys (using 'var') produced a compile error, as expected [ ].

// 4. Nested maps and state reassignments: Complex nested map structures and reassignments of persistent maps behave as expected. Our nested maps test returns the correct inner value,
//    and reassigning a persistent map to empty or null results in expected behavior.

// 5. asCell: Calling .asCell() on an empty map returns null rather than an empty Cell, which is consistent with the documentation.

// Based on our comprehensive fuzz testing covering valid combinations of key/value types, methods (set, replace, replaceGet, exists, deepEquals, del, asCell), and boundary cases,
// we have not encountered any discrepancies between the reported Tact documentation and the compiler behavior regarding maps.

contract MapFuzzTestSummary {

    // This getter summarizes the results expected from our various tests.
    get fun summary(): String {
        return "All map operations including allowed key/value types, serialization annotations, nested maps, and methods (set, replace, replaceGet, exists, del, deepEquals, asCell) behave as documented. Invalid key/value types correctly fail compilation. No discrepancies found."
