Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
This comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle was focused on deeply examining Tact maps. Our systematic approach tested every significant aspect of maps as documented in the official Tact references, such as the allowed key/value types, serialization behavior, map operations (insertion, deletion, updating, querying), nested map support and its iteration constraints, as well as shallow vs deep equality comparisons.

Documentation Insights:
-----------------------
According to the official Tact documentation (refer to sections in docs_book_maps.md and related operator docs in docs_book_operators.md):

• Only Int and Address are permitted as map key types. Our tests confirmed that valid maps (e.g. map<Int, Int> and map<Address, Int>) compile successfully, whereas attempts using invalid key types (e.g., String or user-defined structs) lead to expected compile-time errors.

• Allowed value types include Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types. Additionally, Tact supports serialization for Int keys/values (using modifiers such as "as uint8"), a facility which our tests confirmed by successfully compiling customized serialized maps.

• Core map operations (.set, .get, .exists, .replace, .replaceGet, and .del) were thoroughly validated. Our tests verified correct insertion, modification, and deletion behaviors—comparing against examples provided in the documentation [citeturn0file0–citeturn0file5].

• Nested maps and iteration are supported provided that maps are accessed through valid path expressions (e.g., self.data) rather than arbitrary function calls. Attempts to iterate over maps not referenced in this manner correctly result in compilation errors, matching the documented constraints [citeturn8file].

• Equality comparisons follow a clear distinction: the shallow equality operator (==) compares the underlying cell hashes, while the .deepEquals() function does an entry-by-entry comparison. Our results confirm this behavior exactly as described in the documentation [citeturn0file7 and citeturn0file4].

Testing Summary:
----------------
• Valid map instances were created with Int and Address keys and worked seamlessly with operations like insertion, querying, replacement, and deletion.

• Attempts using disallowed key types were uniformly rejected, assuring strict adherence to allowed type constraints.

• Serialized maps (e.g., map<Int as uint8, Int as uint8>) function correctly, yielding expected outcomes.

• Nested maps managed through proper path expressions support iteration, whereas improper access causes compile-time errors, thereby meeting language restrictions.

• Shallow versus deep equality checks reflected the documented differences, where deep equality provides a full comparison of entries.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle confirms that maps in Tact operate exactly as documented with no detected discrepancies or unexpected behaviors. The Tact compiler enforces all constraints on key and value types precisely, supports the required serialization options, and implements map operations and iteration restrictions accurately. 

Final Verdict: All tests passed successfully, with the representative final test contract returning 0.
