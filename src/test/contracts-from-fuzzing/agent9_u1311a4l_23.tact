// Final Fuzz-Testing Report on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact
// 
// Summary:
// In this comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle, we targeted the bounced messages feature and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts, referencing key documentation:
//   - The bounced messages documentation (docs_book_bounced.md  )
//   - Contract receiver guidelines and bounce receiver usage (docs_book_contracts.md  )
//   - Messaging and outbound message handling (docs_book_send.md  )
// 
// We executed tests in the following categories:
// 
// 1. Standard Bounce Receiver Declaration:
//    - A bounce receiver declared with a type like bounced<MyMessage> compiled successfully, confirming that using the specialized type for bounced messages is valid and in line with documentation.
// 
// 2. Invalid Receiver Declarations:
//    - Bounce receivers with invalid parameter types (such as Int or an incorrect type like Cell) were correctly rejected. Error messages made it clear that the only acceptable types are bounced<T>, message, or Slice.
//    - Additionally, omitting a parameter entirely from a bounce receiver triggered expected compile-time errors.
// 
// 3. Fallback Handling with Slice:
//    - Bounce receivers that use Slice (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiled without issue, allowing contracts to capture all bounced messages, as described in docs_book_bounced.md.
// 
// 4. State Modification within Bounce Receivers:
//    - We tested state changes (eg. updating a counter) within bounce receivers, and these state updates worked as expected. This behavior conforms with the documentation since bounce receivers are allowed to modify state unlike getters.
// 
// 5. Multiple Bounce Receivers for the Same Message Type:
//    - Defining two bounce receivers for the same message type produced a compiler conflict error, ensuring unambiguous behavior—this matches the intended language restrictions.
// 
// 6. Advanced Control Flow Using Try-Catch:
//    - Incorporating try-catch inside a bounce receiver confirms that error handling constructs are supported. Initially, a syntax error (missing catch parameter) needed a minor correction, after which the compilation was successful.
// 
// 7. Cross-Contract and Recursive Bounce Handling:
//    - Tests involving chained interactions, such as sending messages via self.reply()/self.notify() within bounce receivers and cross-contract bounce propagation, both compiled and suggested behavior in line with documentation (e.g. as seen in messaging examples in docs_book_send.md).
// 
// 8. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
//    - A test attempting to handle a bounced message whose payload exceeded the allowable 224-bit data limit produced the correct compile-time error. This enforcement is consistent with the TON network limitations and the recommendations in the documentation.
// 
// Conclusion:
// All fuzz-testing experiments confirmed that the Tact compiler’s treatment of bounced messages and bounce receivers aligns perfectly with the documented specifications. No discrepancies or hidden bugs were uncovered during extensive testing across valid and invalid cases.
// 
// This fuzz-testing cycle is now complete in this feature area and further testing will continue into other contract functionalities.
