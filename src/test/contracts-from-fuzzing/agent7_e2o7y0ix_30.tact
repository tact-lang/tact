    dump("Final Extended Fuzz Testing Report:\n\nMaps: Extensive tests have verified all documented behaviors. Operations such as insertion, deletion, retrieval, iteration (including foreach restrictions on non-path expressions), comparison with shallow equality (==) and deepEquals(), serialization with fixed-width formats, and nested maps (requiring an extra space between closing angle brackets) all function as described in docs (see docs_book_maps.md, docs_book_statements.md).\n\nBitwise Operators: Standard bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, shifts) on Int values yield expected results and were thoroughly tested.\n\nStructs and Messages: Initialization, field access, nested destructuring, and using maps as struct fields work flawlessly, as observed in our tests (with reference to examples in docs_book_maps.md and docs_book_statements.md).\n\nError Handling: try-catch correctly captures errors such as cell underflow (exit code 9), confirming robustness in error handling.\n\nContract State Modifications and Getter Behavior: Our tests confirm that while getters can perform state modifications at runtime, these changes are ephemeral, matching the updated documentation clarification (https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#getter-functions).\n\nConclusion: All fuzz testing cycles across maps, bitwise operators, structs & messages, error handling, and state modifications behaved exactly as specified. The only nuance is the syntactic requirement in nested generics. No significant compiler bugs or documentation mismatches were detected.\n\nContinuing exploration of other compiler features...");
