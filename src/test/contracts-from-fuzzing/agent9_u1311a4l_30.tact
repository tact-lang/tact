// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact

/*
Summary:
---------
In this extensive fuzz-testing cycle, we rigorously examined bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts. We referenced the official documentation (e.g. docs_book_bounced.md  , docs_book_contracts.md  , and docs_book_send.md  ) and validated the following key points:

1. Standard Bounce Receiver Usage:
   • Declaring a bounce receiver as: 
         bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
     successfully compiles and behaves as expected.

2. Invalid Receiver Declarations:
   • Bounce receivers with invalid types (e.g., Int or Cell) or missing parameters result in proper compile-time errors. The messages reflect the requirement that only bounced<T>, message types, or Slice are allowed.

3. Fallback Receiver Handling:
   • A fallback bounce receiver defined with a Slice parameter (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiles without errors, matching documented behavior.

4. State Modifications in Bounce Receivers:
   • State modifications (like incrementing a counter) are allowed inside bounce receivers, which is consistent with the intended use (contrast with getter functions).

5. Receiver Conflict Prevention:
   • Compiling contracts with multiple bounce receivers for the same message type correctly triggers a conflict error, preventing ambiguity.

6. Advanced Constructs (Try-Catch & Recursive Handling):
   • Incorporating try-catch blocks (proper syntax required) within bounce receivers compiles successfully.
   • Recursive and cross-contract scenarios (e.g., using self.reply() and self.notify()) also conform to the expected behavior.

7. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
   • Attempting to operate on bounced messages exceeding the 224 usable data bits triggers a compile-time error, verifying strict size limits as documented.

Conclusion:
------------
All tests confirmed that the Tact compiler’s behavior for bounced messages and bounce receivers strictly aligns with the official documentation. No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were found. This confirms a robust and compliant implementation, and the testing continues into other features in subsequent cycles.
