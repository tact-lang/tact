/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
In this fuzz-testing cycle, we conducted an in-depth examination of maps in Tact by focusing on:

• Allowed key and value types
• Serialization behavior
• Core map operations (.set, .get, .exists, .replace, .replaceGet, .del)
• Nested maps and iteration restrictions
• Equality semantics (shallow vs deep equality)

Our analysis was guided by the official Tact documentation on maps, which clearly states (see   and related excerpts) that permitted key types are restricted to Int and Address, and only certain value types (including Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types) are allowed. In addition, only integer keys support serialized representations (e.g., as uint8).

Testing Summary:
----------------
1. Allowed Key Types:
   • Valid maps declared with Int (e.g. map<Int, Int>) and Address (e.g. map<Address, Int>) compile and function as expected (TestMapValid and TestAddressKey).
   • Attempts to use disallowed key types such as String or user-defined struct types result in clear compile-time errors, confirming that the compiler enforces restrictions as documented (see TestInvalidKey and TestStructKey tests).

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   • Maps with value types, including Int and Bool, compile and return expected values. In addition, maps declared with explicit serialization (e.g. map<Int as uint8, Int as uint8>) successfully operate with reduced storage cost, in agreement with the documentation (see   for serialization details).

3. Map Operations:
   • Insertion via .set(), querying via .get() and .exists(), replacement via .replace() and .replaceGet(), and deletion via .del() function exactly as the documentation outlines. Tests (TestMapOps, TestMapSummary) confirmed that operations return the proper boolean values and modify the map state as expected.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration Limitations:
   • Nested maps were implemented by encapsulating an inner map within a struct (e.g. AllowanceMap) and then storing it in an outer map keyed by Address. Iteration through foreach is only permitted when the map expression is a valid path expression (e.g. self.data), and attempts to iterate over maps returned by functions correctly result in errors, as documented (see   for iteration examples).

5. Equality Comparisons:
   • Our tests differentiate between shallow equality (using the '==' operator, which compares map cell hashes) and deep equality (using .deepEquals(), which performs an entry-by-entry comparison). The observed behaviors match the documented specifications precisely (refer to  ).

6. Edge Cases – Boolean Values:
   • After resolving minor syntactic issues with if/else constructs, maps with Bool values compile and execute as expected, further confirming the allowed range of value types.

Conclusion:
-----------
All fuzz-testing scenarios confirm that the Tact compiler enforces the documented constraints for maps. In summary:

- Only Int and Address are allowed as keys; invalid key types are rejected as expected.
- Allowed value types, including serialized forms for Int, behave as documented.
- Core operations for maps (insertion, querying, updating, deletion) function correctly.
- Iteration over nested maps is valid only when accessed by proper path expressions.
- Shallow and deep equality comparisons work distinctly according to documentation.

No discrepancies or compiler bugs were found, and the Tact compiler’s behavior consistently aligns with the official documentation.
