Comprehensive Map Fuzz-Testing Extended Summary

In our extended fuzz-testing cycle for maps in Tact, we've deeply explored a variety of edge cases, including:

1. Basic Map Operations:
   • Insertion, retrieval, deletion, and replacement using methods such as set(), get(), replace(), and replaceGet().

2. Equality Mechanisms:
   • Shallow equality using the binary operator (==) has been verified to depend on cell hash serialization. As expected, two maps with same key/value pairs but inserted in different orders can yield false for shallow equality (==).
   • In contrast, using deepEquals() correctly returns true, as it compares the entries irrespective of insertion order.

3. Arithmetic and Expression Evaluation within Map Keys:
   • Map keys being results of arithmetic expressions (e.g. 1/2, 2+2, negative values, and large integers) are handled as per standard integer arithmetic, demonstrating that the compiler performs integer division and preserves sign correctly.

4. Serialization and Compact Representation:
   • Maps using serialization modifiers (e.g. keys and values as "as uint8") in a struct have been tested, and stored values are correctly retrieved, confirming that the serialization behavior matches the documentation.

5. Nested Maps:
   • We embedded a map within a struct (AllowanceMap) and then nested this struct as a value in an outer map. Retrieval from the nested map correctly returns the expected value, in line with the documentation examples.

6. Modification During Iteration:
   • We attempted modifications during a foreach iteration (e.g. deleting keys within the iteration loop). Although such operations require caution in runtime behavior, the compiler caught the syntactic requirements properly (e.g., iteration only allowed over path expressions).

7. Error Conditions:
   • Tests using disallowed key types (e.g. using a struct as key) and iterating over maps returned by a function were executed, and the compiler emitted the expected errors. This confirms the robustness of type-checking and allowed map usage as documented.

8. Advanced Replacement Operations:
   • Successive operations replacing an existing value followed by deletion (via replacing with null) behaved as intended, with replaceGet() returning the old value on success, then null when the key is deleted.

Across these exhaustive tests, no anomalies, compiler bugs, or deviations from the official documentation have been detected for map-related features. Every observed behavior, error message, and warning corresponded precisely with the documented expectations.

We will continue our fuzz-testing process to explore additional compiler features in a similarly thorough and systematic manner.
