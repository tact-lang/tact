Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report: Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
In this comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle, we deeply examined the implementation, documentation, and behavior of maps in Tact. Our focus was on validating key and value type restrictions, serialization details, core operations, nested map usage, iteration constraints, and equality comparisons. All our tests were designed as minimal reproducible snippets and compared against documented claims.

Documentation Context:
----------------------
• According to the official maps documentation [ ], allowed key types are strictly limited to Int and Address. Our tests confirmed that maps declared with these key types work as expected, and the compiler rejects any deviation (e.g. using String or Struct types as keys, as seen in our failed TestInvalidKey and TestStructKey tests).

• The documentation clearly details the allowed value types for maps (Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types). Moreover, only integer types (Int) support serialization (using formats like "as uint8") [ ]. Our TestSerializedMap confirms that specifying serialization for both keys and values returns correct results.

• Map operations such as insertion (.set), query (.get, .exists), replacement (.replace, .replaceGet), and deletion (.del) are documented [ ,  ] to behave in predictable ways. Our dedicated snippets (e.g. TestMapOps and TestMapSummary) validated that:
  - Insertion via .set() successfully associates keys with values.
  - Query operations via .exists() or .get() accurately reflect the presence or absence of keys.
  - Replacements using .replace() and .replaceGet() return correct old values or booleans.
  - Deletion via .del or setting a key’s value to null effectively removes the entry.

• Nested maps were also rigorously tested. By encapsulating an inner map in a struct (e.g. AllowanceMap) and storing it in an outer map keyed by Address, we confirmed that nested maps work properly, provided they are accessed as valid path expressions (e.g. using self.data) [ ]. Iteration through foreach over maps is allowed only with such proper references, and our tests confirm the expected errors when misused.

• Shallow versus Deep Equality is an important point in the documentation. Our test TestMapDeepEquals confirmed that using the equality operator (==) compares the underlying serialized cell hashes (which might give false negatives if serialization differs), whereas the deepEquals method performs an entry-by-entry comparison, as described [ ].

• Finally, for maps with Bool values, after slight syntax revisions (moving from ambiguous if-expression forms to explicit if/else constructs), our tests (TestMapBoolFixed) verified that Boolean values are valid and work seamlessly.

Summary of Findings:
---------------------
1. Allowed key types are enforced precisely as documented—only Int and Address are permitted. All tests with valid keys succeeded, whereas tests with disallowed types failed initially with clear error messages.

2. Allowed value types—including support for serialization with Int types—work exactly as documented. Insertion, replacement, deletion, and query operations all return correct and expected outcomes.

3. Nested maps and iteration constructs are supported when maps are accessed via valid identifiers (or proper nested expressions), in line with documentation restrictions.

4. The differentiation between shallow equality (==) and entry-by-entry deep comparison (deepEquals) is correctly implemented by the compiler.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our exhaustive fuzz-testing cycle indicates that the Tact compiler’s handling of maps aligns entirely with the official documentation. There are no discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs in this area. All edge cases related to key/value validations, serialized maps, operational methods, and iteration constraints behave as described in the docs.
