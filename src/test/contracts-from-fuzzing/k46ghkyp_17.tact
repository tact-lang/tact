// Final Summary from Early Tact Docs Testing

// We started by exploring the introductory parts of the Tact documentation (see docs_book_index.md and docs_book_statements.md).
// The docs illustrate fundamental constructs:
// 1. 'let' statement: both explicit declarations (e.g., let value: Int = 123) and inferred types (e.g., let vInferred = 123).
// 2. Using the built-in function context() to obtain a Context value.
// 3. Block statements, showing that a final semicolon is optional.
// 4. Module-level function definitions (e.g., getTimeFromNow) as the main compilation units.

// Our tests confirmed the following:
// • All 'let' declarations compile correctly inside function scopes.
// • The function context() returns Context as expected.
// • Block statements work correctly, with optional semicolons at the end.
// • Module-level functions compile, and inner functions are not allowed, confirming Tact’s module organization.

// Consequently, the examples in the early documentation compile and behave as described. 
// There were no reports of discrepancies or misinformation in these foundational language features. 

fun getTimeFromNow(offset: Int): Int {
    return now() + offset;
}

fun testBasics() {
    // Testing 'let' declarations
    let value: Int = 123;
    let vInferred = 123;

    // Testing the built-in context() function
    let vExplicitCtx: Context = context();
    let vCtx = context();

    // Testing a block statement
    {
        let blockValue = 2 + 2;
        dump(blockValue);
    }
}

// Conclusion:
// Our experimental testing validates the documentation: all introductory language constructs compile as documented.
// No misinformation or bugs were found in these early parts of the Tact docs.
