// Comprehensive testing cycle report for asm functions in Tact
//
// Our testing cycle covered multiple facets of asm functions using a variety of carefully constructed minimal snippets. We focused on subtle and sophisticated edge cases, including:
//
// 1. Basic asm function functionality with TVM instructions:
//    - asm fun answer(): Int { 42 PUSHINT } (compiles and works as expected)
//
// 2. Ensuring primitives must always be paired with a consuming instruction:
//    - asm fun bad(): Int { 43 } (produces compilation error because the primitive '43' is not associated with an instruction)
//
// 3. Basic arithmetic operation with two parameters:
//    - asm fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int { ADD } (adds two numbers correctly).
//
// 4. Testing argument arrangement using a struct Pair and swapping of parameters:
//    - asm(a b -> 1 0) fun swap(a: Int, b: Int): Pair { } with struct Pair { first: Int; second: Int } (swaps parameters as expected).
//
// 5. Testing nested struct flattening of parameters:
//    - struct A { x: Int; y: Int } and asm fun sumA(a: A): Int { ADD } (flattens the struct and sums its fields properly).
//
// 6. Parameter name that conflicts with an existing TVM instruction:
//    - asm fun conflict(DROP: Int): Int { DROP } (here the parameter name collides with the TVM instruction 'DROP'. In assembly functions, parameter names are not directly accessible in the body; the body only processes TVM instructions. This test behaves as per the design, with 'DROP' being interpreted as the TVM instruction rather than a parameter reference.)
//
// 7. Pushing a large integer constant to ensure correct opcode variation:
//    - asm fun pushBig(): Int { 999 PUSHINT } (actioning proper opcode for numbers outside the immediate range).
//
// 8. Testing an asm function with an empty body while having a declared return type:
//    - asm fun identityEmpty(x: Int): Int { } (compiles, though at runtime calling it might result in a stack underflow, which is consistent with the design since no instructions push a value).
//
// 9. Testing the placement of attributes: handling the inline attribute.
//    - The snippet 'inline asm fun inlineTest(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }' failed due to ordering, but reordering as 'asm inline fun inlineTest(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }' compiled successfully, aligning with expectations.
//
// Across these tests of asm functions, we found that the documentation claims are met. We did not identify any undocumented behavior or significant mismatches between the official documentation and the compiler behavior in our robust exploration.
//
// Our cycle thus confirms that the asm functions feature adheres to the documented behavior concerning argument/return arrangements, parameter handling, instruction pairing with primitives, and attribute parsing.
//
// We now conclude the comprehensive exploration of asm functions with no confirmed critical issues detected.

// Final note: The asm functions remain an advanced and experimental feature. Users must exercise caution due to the minimal error reporting and type checking, as documented.
