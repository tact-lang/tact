 Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for initOf and Cross-Contract Relationships

 This series of tests explores the behavior of the initOf directive and how it is used in various cross-contract scenarios in Tact. The tests include:

 1. Simple cross-contract initialization:
    - Contract A obtains the initial state of contract B using initOf. (Snippet 1)
    - Result: Compiles successfully.

 2. Multi-level and hierarchical parent-child relationships:
    - Contract A calls initOf on B; Contract B further calls initOf on C. (Snippet 2, Snippet 5)
    - Result: Both snippets compile as expected, indicating proper propagation and packaging of initial code and data across multiple hierarchy levels.

 3. Self-recursive usage:
    - A contract uses initOf to fetch its own code cell within a function. (Snippet 3)
    - Result: Compiles successfully, demonstrating that self-referential initialization expressions are handled as documented.

 4. Cyclic or cross-dependent initialization:
    - Two contracts, A and B, are designed so that A’s init calls initOf on B, and B’s init calls initOf on A. (Snippet 4)
    - Result: Compiles without error. Although cyclic dependencies might seem unexpected, the compiler processes the initOf expressions without an immediate runtime error. This edge case merits further analysis from a dependency resolution perspective and potential runtime implications.

 5. Three-level hierarchical contract initialization:
    - A chain usage: A -> B -> C -> D, where each contract’s init calls initOf of the next. (Snippet 5)
    - Result: Compiles successfully, showing that deep nested contract graphs are efficiently processed.

 6. Use of initOf with contracts that have parameters:
    - A contract defined with parameters (ParamContract) attempts to define an explicit init alongside parameters. (Snippet 6)
    - Expected behavior: As per documentation on contract parameters (see docs_book_contracts.md), using init() alongside contract parameters should trigger a compilation error. Result: The snippet fails compilation with an error message: "init() cannot be used along with contract parameters", confirming that the documentation and compiler behavior align.

 7. Branching contract graphs (multiple child initializations):
    - A contract graph where a parent (Intermediate or Root) initializes multiple leaf contracts (Leaf1, Leaf2). (Snippet 7)
    - Result: Compiles successfully, indicating that multiple initOf calls on different contracts in one initializer are correctly processed.

 8. Usage within getter functions:
    - A getter function uses initOf to fetch the contract’s own code cell. (Snippet 8)
    - Result: Compiles without issues, and behaves as documented (refer to docs_book_expressions.md on initOf and codeOf).

 Summary:
 The extensive fuzz-testing of initOf reveals a robust implementation for simple, deep, and branching cross-contract relationships. Notably, the cyclic dependency case compiled without errors, which might require further runtime analysis. Also, the expected error for mixing contract parameters with an explicit init() is correctly raised. 

 These results confirm that the documented functionality of initOf—covering cross-contract initialization, hierarchical and recursive relationships, and usage in various contract functions—is consistent with the compiler's actual behavior. Developers should be cautious with cyclic dependencies as they might have unforeseen runtime implications even though the compiler does not prevent them.
