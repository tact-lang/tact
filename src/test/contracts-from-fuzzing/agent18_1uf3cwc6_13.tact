Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Summary for Maps in Tact

In this testing cycle we focused on validating various aspects of maps (dictionaries) in Tact, as described by the official documentation. Our tests included:

1. Allowed Key/Value Types:
   - We successfully created maps with Int keys and Int values, as seen in testIntMap(), confirming that basic usage is correct.
   - For keys of type Address, our tests (via myAddress()) behaved as expected. For example, testNestedMaps() wrapped a nested map via a struct (AllowanceMap) and correctly retrieved the stored value.

2. Disallowed Types:
   - We attempted to declare maps with non-allowed key and value types (e.g. map<String, Int> and map<Int, String>) and saw that the compiler emitted proper errors. This behavior aligns with the documentation which restricts map keys to Int and Address only. 

3. Map Methods:
   - Methods such as .set(), .get(), .del(), .replace(), .replaceGet(), and .exists() have been rigorously tested. Tests involving replacing a value with a new one returned the expected outcomes (e.g. testReplaceDelete() returned a score corresponding to a successful replacement and deletion).
   - The deepEquals() method was tested against the shallow (==) equality operator, and the results were consistent with the documentation.

4. Iteration and State Checks:
   - Iterative constructs using foreach were exercised in testIteration() and produced consistent results, confirming that iteration over maps is limited to path expressions as required by Tact.
   - Additionally, tests for isEmpty() and null comparisons worked as per the guidance.

5. Nested Maps:
   - Although directly nesting maps (like map<Int, map<Int, Int>>) is not permitted, our approach using a wrapper struct (AllowanceMap) allowed us to simulate nested maps, matching the documentation examples.

Throughout all these tests, no discrepancies were observed between the official documentation and the Tact compiler's behavior regarding maps. All operations worked as documented, and edge cases (such as deleting via setting a keyâ€™s value to null and using .replaceGet()) behaved as documented.

Conclusion:
Our extensive fuzz-testing yields no confirmed issues or deviations. The Tact compiler enforces the documented map restrictions (allowed key types, serialization rules, iteration constraints, etc.) and provides the behavior stipulated in the documentation. Therefore, regarding maps, the implementation is robust and consistent with the official Tact specification.
