// Final Summary Report: Testing asm functions in Tact
//
// In our comprehensive testing cycle, we explored the asm functions feature in several aspects:
//
// 1. Basic assembly function behavior: The function asm fun answer(): Int { 42 PUSHINT } compiles and pushes a constant to the stack, as documented in the sections discussing TVM instructions [ ,  ].
//
// 2. Enforcing instruction usage in asm function bodies: The snippet asm fun bad(): Int { 43 } correctly triggers a compilation error because a lone primitive (43) was given without any consuming TVM instruction. This aligns with the documentation that every primitive must be paired with an instruction [ ].
//
// 3. Arithmetic operations and parameter handling: For instance, asm fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int { ADD } added two numbers correctly, and tests mixing parameter arrangements (like asm(a b -> 1 0) fun swap(a: Int, b: Int): Pair { }) verified that argument reordering and struct flattening work as described [ ].
//
// 4. Edge cases such as using large integer constants (999 PUSHINT) were confirmed to generate the correct opcode as discussed in the documentation [ ].
//
// 5. Testing atypical syntactic arrangements: The inline attribute must be placed after the asm keyword (asm inline fun ...) to compile correctly, and our tests confirmed the parser enforces this order. This is consistent with the documented syntax [ ].
//
// 6. Additional tests involving empty function bodies (asm fun identityEmpty(x: Int): Int { }) compile successfully even though no value is returned. While this may result in a stack underflow at runtime if called, the compile-time behavior is consistent with the expectations that asm functions must only include TVM instructions [ ].
//
// Throughout all these tests, we observed compiler behavior that perfectly aligns with the official documentation on asm functions, their argument and return arrangements, TS compatibility with nested structs, and attribute enforcement.
//
// Conclusion: Our comprehensive and persistent exploration yielded no significant compiler bugs or discrepancies with documentation for asm functions. The experimental nature of asm functions means that caution is advised, but as per the documentation (see sections in docs_book_assembly-functions.md), the implementation details behave as specified.
