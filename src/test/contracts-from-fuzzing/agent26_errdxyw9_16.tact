// Summary of Fuzz-Testing Cycle for initOf and Cross-Contract Relationships
//
// In this comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle, we created a variety of Tact snippets aimed at verifying the documented behaviour of the initOf expression, cross-contract dependencies, recursive initialization, and various edge cases such as circular dependencies, parameter passing (including trailing commas), and integrated use cases combining initOf with contractAddress.
//
// The tests include:
//  1. Simple cross-contract initialization where one contract (B) obtains the initial state of another (A).
//  2. Multi-level initialization with parameters in parent-child contract structures (e.g., Child and Parent).
//  3. Complex dependency graphs: a contract obtaining initOf of multiple other contracts and composing them into structs (CombinedDeps).
//  4. Recursive cases where a contract calls initOf on itself (Recursion and RecursiveGetter).
//  5. Circular dependencies between two contracts (CircA and CircB).
//  6. Parameter handling edge cases (TestParams) ensuring trailing commas and proper argument passing.
//  7. Multiple simultaneous initOf calls with the same contract (DoubleRef).
//  8. Integration tests where computed initial state is used to derive contract addresses (GetInit, SelfReceiver).
//
// All tests compiled as expected consistent with the documentation (refer to the initOf section in docs_book_expressions.md, see  , and related documentation in docs_ref_core-addresses.md,  ). The intended erroneous usage (missing required arguments) produced a compile-time error, confirming the compiler correctly enforces parameter requirements.
//
// At this point, no significant discrepancies or compiler bugs have been identified that contradict the documented behaviour. The implementation of initOf and cross-contract dependency resolution appears robust under the tested scenarios.
//
// The fuzz-testing cycle will continue to explore additional edge cases and interplays with other Tact features to ensure complete compliance with the official documentation, but no major issues have been confirmed thus far.

contract FinalTest {
    // This contract is included to summarize the cross-contract testing of initOf.
    // It combines various elements tested above.

    get fun summaryCheck(): Bool {
        // Verify that the computed address of this contract matches that of myAddress()
        let s: StateInit = initOf FinalTest();
        let computed: Address = contractAddress(s);
        return myAddress() == computed;
    }
}
