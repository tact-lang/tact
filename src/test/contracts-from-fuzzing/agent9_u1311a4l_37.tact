// Comprehensive Final Answer

/*
Final Summary:
-------------
Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle on bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality confirms that the Tact compiler behaves as documented. A brief summary of our findings follows:

1. Standard Usage:
   • Bounce receiver functions declared with a custom message type (for example, using:
       bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
     ) compile as expected. This validates the basic usage specified in the documentation (see docs_book_bounced.md).

2. Invalid Declarations:
   • Bounce receivers declared with an incorrect parameter type (e.g., Int or Cell) or defined without any parameter trigger compile-time errors. The error messages explicitly require the parameter to be of type bounced<T>, message, or Slice, precisely as documented.

3. Fallback Handling:
   • Using a bounce receiver that accepts a raw Slice (for instance, bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiles successfully, allowing contracts to serve as catch-all handlers for bounced messages. This aligns with the fallback behavior described in the docs.

4. State Modifications:
   • Bounce receivers can modify state (e.g., updating a counter), which is permitted even though getter functions are not allowed to make state changes. Thus, bounce receivers offer the necessary flexibility for error handling and state recovery.

5. Duplicate Receiver Prevention:
   • The Tact compiler correctly prevents multiple bounce receivers for the same message type by throwing a conflict error, thereby enforcing a unique handler per message type.

6. Advanced Control Flow:
   • Incorporation of error handling constructs (try-catch with appropriate syntax) and scenarios involving recursive or cross-contract behavior (using self.reply() or self.notify()) compile and behave as expected.

7. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
   • Attempts to modify bounced messages so that their payloads exceed the 224 usable data bits limit result in compile-time errors, consistent with the documented constraint.

Conclusion:
-----------
All test cases—from standard scenarios to edge cases and invalid code examples—demonstrate that the Tact compiler’s handling of bounced messages and bounce receivers is robust and strictly adherent to the documentation. No deviations or unexpected behaviors were observed.

This confirms that the bounce receiver feature in Tact contracts is correctly implemented, and our fuzz-testing cycle can now proceed to further language features in subsequent cycles.
