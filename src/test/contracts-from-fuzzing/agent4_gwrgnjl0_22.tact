Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report: Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
In this comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle, we deeply examined the implementation, documentation, and behavior of maps in Tact—specifically focusing on allowed key/value types, serialization methods, and core operations (insertion, deletion, querying, updating, and iteration). We performed a series of targeted tests to validate the documented behavior and boundary conditions. Throughout the process, all tests behaved consistently with the official Tact documentation.

Documentation Reviewed:
-------------------------
1. The official maps documentation, which outlines that allowed key types are limited to Int and Address, and allowed value types include Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types (see   for an overview).
2. Serialization details that only allow serialized formats for Int types (see  ).
3. Detailed behavior of map operations—such as .set(), .get(), .exists(), .replace(), .replaceGet(), .del(), and comparison operators including shallow equality (==) and deep equality (.deepEquals()) (see  ,  , and   for specific examples).

Test Summary:
-------------
1. Allowed Key Types: 
   • Successfully compiled maps with Int and Address as keys (TestMapValid, TestAddressKey).
   • Ruled out disallowed key types; attempts to define maps with String keys or Struct keys resulted in explicit compile-time errors (TestInvalidKey, TestStructKey), in line with the documentation.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   • Maps with Int, Bool, and serialized integer types (e.g., Int as uint8) worked correctly, verifying that serialization is only applicable for Int-typed keys/values as described (TestSerializedMap).

3. Map Operations:
   • Insertion (.set), querying (.get and .exists), update/replacement (.replace and .replaceGet), and deletion (.del or setting a null value) behaved exactly as specified. Intermediate tests (TestMapOps, TestMapSummary) confirmed that operations return appropriate results and update state correctly.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration:
   • Nested maps were successfully implemented by encapsulating inner maps in structs (e.g., AllowanceMap) and storing them in an outer map keyed by Address. Iteration using foreach worked as documented only on valid path expressions (self.data) while attempts to iterate directly over function-returned maps correctly yielded compile-time errors.

5. Equality Comparisons:
   • The distinction between shallow equality (using the '==' operator) and deep equality (using .deepEquals()) was validated (TestMapDeepEquals). Our results show that comparing map hashes with '==' may result in false negatives when serialization differs, but deepEquals accurately detects equivalence when entries are identical.

6. Boolean Map Values:
   • Maps storing Bool values compiled and executed once proper syntactical constructs were used (TestMapBoolFixed), confirming that Bool is a valid value type.

Conclusion:
-----------
All tests performed in this fuzz-testing cycle confirmed that Tact maps adhere to the behavior outlined in the official documentation. The Tact compiler enforces allowed key types (only Int and Address), supports serialization for Int types only, and implements all standard operations as documented.

No discrepancies or compiler bugs were identified. Every edge case and operation executed matched the expectations set by the Tact documentation.
