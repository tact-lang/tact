// Final answer summarizing our investigation:

/*
Investigation Summary:

We've started by examining the earliest sections of the Tact documentation (refer to docs_book_index.md for an overview of the Tact Book and docs_book_statements.md for details on statements). The key points described in these documents include:

1. Variable Declarations:
   • The 'let' statement works as documented. Both explicit type annotations (e.g., let value: Int = 123) and type inference (e.g., let vInferred = 123) compile without issues.

2. Built-in Functions:
   • The built-in function context() properly returns a Context structure, matching the examples provided in the documentation.

3. Block Statements:
   • Blocks, defined by braces { }, allow grouping of statements with the trailing semicolon on the last statement being optional.

4. Function Declarations and Module Scope:
   • Tact requires all code to reside within functions (module-level code). Attempting to declare variables directly at the top level (outside any function) yields a compilation error, which is consistent with the intended design described in the docs.

Our compilation tests have confirmed these constructs compile and behave as expected:
   - 'let' statements, context() usage and blocks compile successfully when encapsulated in functions.
   - Top-level module structure enforces function declarations, aligning with the documented examples.

Conclusion: The earliest parts of the Tact documentation accurately describe the language constructs, and our tests reveal no discrepancies, bugs, or misinformation. Everything works as documented.
