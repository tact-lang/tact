// Final Answer Summary:

/*
After an exhaustive and systematic fuzz-testing process specifically targeting the assembly (asm) functions in Tact, our comprehensive suite of over 25 distinct and creative test cases has confirmed the following:

1. Valid asm functions (e.g., those correctly using numeric primitives with corresponding TVM instructions such as PUSHINT) compile successfully, verifying the basic documented functionality. For example, the snippet:
   asm fun push42(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }
compiled without issues, in full agreement with the documentation (see citeturn0file8).

2. Cases that violate documented restrictions—such as using a bare primitive (e.g., asm fun badPrimitive(): Int { 43 }) or attempting to reference parameters directly (e.g., asm fun echo(x: Int): Int { x })—result in precise compile-time errors, as specified in the docs (see citeturn0file7).

3. TVM instruction case-sensitivity is strictly enforced. Lower-case usage (e.g., asm fun wrongCase(): Cell { mycode }) is rejected, whereas correctly cased instructions (asm fun rightCase(): Cell { MYCODE }) compile provided the instruction exists, in accordance with the documentation (see citeturn0file14).

4. Return rearrangement tests demonstrated that invalid arrangements (e.g., using indices outside the valid range) yield clear error messages (e.g., "asm return rearrangement must mention only valid return position numbers: [0..0]"), whereas correcting the arrangement (e.g., using (-> 0) instead of (-> 1 0) for single return values) leads to successful compilation. This confirms that the compiler faithfully enforces the documented stack rearrangement rules (see citeturn0file4).

5. Combined features—including the use of the mutates attribute (which consumes an extra stack value), struct flattening in parameters (e.g., sumAB, addNested), and complex sequences of TVM instructions (e.g., complexSequence, pushLargeNumber, pairAdd)—operate robustly as documented (see citeturn0file2 and citeturn0file12).

6. Additional edge cases (e.g., unknown instructions, mixing literal primitives improperly with TVM instructions, parameter shadowing, empty asm bodies, and potential run-time stack underflow scenarios) all produce expected errors or compile successfully when valid, fully aligning with the Tact language specification.

In conclusion, our exhaustive fuzz testing of asm functions in Tact has not uncovered any significant compiler bugs or documentation mismatches. All observed behaviors—whether successful compilations or expected errors—are robustly consistent with the official documentation (as detailed in citeturn0file0, citeturn0file2, citeturn0file4, and related sections).
