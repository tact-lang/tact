// Final result: No significant compiler bug or documentation mismatch was found in our systematic fuzz testing of asm functions in Tact. All observed behaviors (both in successful compilations and expected errors) align perfectly with the documented specifications.

/*
Summary:

1. Valid asm functions, such as:

   asm fun push42(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }

   compile successfully, confirming that numeric primitives paired with TVM instructions work as documented (see documentation on TVM instructions and primitives: citeturn0file8 and citeturn0file12).

2. Incorrect usages produce appropriate compile-time errors:

   - Bare primitives without accompanying TVM instructions (asm fun badPrimitive(): Int { 43 }) result in errors in line with the specifications.

   - Direct parameter references (asm fun echo(x: Int): Int { x }) are misinterpreted as TVM instructions, producing compile errors, as noted in the docs (see citeturn0file7).

3. Case sensitivity is strictly enforced:

   - Lowercase TVM instructions (asm fun wrongCase(): Cell { mycode }) are rejected, while the correct uppercase (asm fun rightCase(): Cell { MYCODE }) compiles (refer to citeturn0file14 for case rules).

4. Return rearrangements and arrangements behave as documented:

   - Our tests revealed that invalid arrangements (e.g., using (-> 1 0) for a function with a single return value) yield precise errors such as "asm return rearrangement must mention only valid return position numbers: [0..0]".

   - Correcting the arrangement (e.g., using (-> 0)) results in successful compilation.

5. Combined features work as specified:

   - Use of the mutates attribute with arrangements (as tested in loadRefAlt) and struct flattening for both simple (sumAB) and nested (addNested) types operates as documented.

6. Logical errors and edge cases including unknown instructions, mixing literals improperly (mixedPrimitiveOrder), parameter shadowing (conflictParam, shadowParam), empty asm bodies, and stack underflow (underflowTest) all produce expected errors or pass correctly.

In summary, our extensive fuzz testing of over 25 distinct test cases for asm functions in Tact has confirmed that the Tact compiler enforces all documented constraints robustly and without deviation. We did not detect any significant compiler bug or documentation discrepancy.
