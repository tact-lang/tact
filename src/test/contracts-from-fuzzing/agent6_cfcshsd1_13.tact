/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report
---------------------------------------

Overview:
In this fuzz-testing cycle, we examined two arbitrary sections of the Tact documentation and validated their behavior via targeted code snippets:

1. Getter Functions (referenced in docs_book_contracts.md):
   - Official documentation states that getter functions should only read state variables and not modify them. However, it is understood in practice that while getters can execute modifications at runtime, those changes are not persisted.
   - We implemented the contract 'GetterTest', which includes two getter functions:
       • modifyGetter(): Attempts to increment a stored state variable.
       • readGetter(): Simply returns the stored state variable.
     Our tests confirmed that while the getter can update the variable during execution, those changes remain ephemeral (non-persistent), aligning with practical interpretations of the documentation.

2. Compile-Time Constant Functions (referenced in docs_ref_core-comptime.md):
   - The documentation details that functions such as address(), cell(), slice(), and rawSlice() embed constant values during compilation.
   - We created the contract 'CompileTimeTest' embedding:
       • A compile-time Address via address().
       • A Cell constant via cell() using a base64-encoded string.
       • A Slice constant via slice() using a base64-encoded string.
       • A rawSlice constant via rawSlice() using hexadecimal input.
     The contract compiled successfully, and receiver functions confirmed the embedded values behave according to the documentation.

Observations & Conclusion:
- Getter function modifications at runtime behave as expected: they occur but do not persist, despite the documentation's simplified claim of read-only behavior. This nuance aligns with community clarifications (see docs_book_contracts.md  ).
- Compile-time functions operate precisely as detailed, embedding constants correctly during compilation (see docs_ref_core-comptime.md  ).

No severe discrepancies or documented bugs have been found during this cycle. The behaviors observed are in agreement with practical interpretations of the official documentation. We will pursue additional features in subsequent fuzz-testing cycles to further reaffirm the consistency and reliability of the Tact compiler.
