// Comprehensive testing of asm functions feature
// =====================================================
// Summary:
// We have executed multiple tests against the asm functions functionality in Tact.
//
// Test 1 (asm fun answer): Verified minimal asm function with TVM instruction 'PUSHINT'. Successful.
//
// Test 2 (withoutInstruction): Confirmed that providing a primitive (43) without a consuming TVM instruction triggers a compilation error, as documented.
//
// Test 3 (bocchiThe): Verified that using an invalid parameter name causes a compilation error; the primitive 'BOC' is not recognized, as expected.
//
// Test 4 (swapPair with incomplete arrangement): Confirmed that the compiler enforces the requirement to mention all function parameters in the arrangement clause, as expected based on the documentation. This test raised the error:
//    "asm argument rearrangement must mention all function parameters"
//
// Test 5 (checkDepth): Verified an asm function that uses DEPTH instruction and returns an Int. Successful.
//
// Test 6 (sumAB): Tested an asm function that takes a struct parameter (of type AB) being flattened into two Ints, and then returns their sum via the ADD instruction. Successful.
//
// All tests behaved in accordance with documented behavior, and there were no deviations or subtle issues observed from these tests.
//
// Next step: We will continue exploring further edge cases of asm functions if required.
//
// Document citations regarding asm functions documentation:  ,  , and additional references as noted by tests above.
