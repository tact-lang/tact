Final Fuzz Testing Summary for asm Functions in Tact:

Our comprehensive and systematic fuzz testing cycle of asm functions in Tact involved over 25 distinct and creative test cases specifically designed to stress various aspects of the feature, while avoiding known documented issues. The key findings are summarized below:

1. **Basic Functionality:**
   - Minimal asm functions (e.g., asm fun push42(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }) compile successfully, verifying that numeric primitives must be paired with their TVM instructions as required by the documentation (see details on TVM instructions and primitives in the Tact documentation).

2. **Error Handling When Violations Occur:**
   - Cases like providing a bare primitive without a consuming TVM instruction (e.g., asm fun badPrimitive(): Int { 43 }) generate clear compile-time errors.
   - Direct references to parameters in asm function bodies (e.g., asm fun echo(x: Int): Int { x }) are incorrectly parsed as TVM instructions, which also correctly trigger errors.

3. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - TVM instructions are enforced to be in upper-case. Tests confirmed that using lower-case (asm fun wrongCase(): Cell { mycode }) results in a compile error, while correct upper-case usage (asm fun rightCase(): Cell { MYCODE }) compiles provided the instruction is defined. This matches the explicit documentation requirements.

4. **Return Rearrangement Rules:**
   - Our tests show that invalid return arrangements (like using indices outside the valid range) trigger specific error messages such as "asm return rearrangement must mention only valid return position numbers: [0..0]". When the rearrangement is corrected (e.g., using (-> 0) for functions with a single return value), the code compiles correctly. This behavior confirms that the compiler enforces stack rearrangement rules as documented.

5. **Combined Features and Advanced Use-Cases:**
   - The usage of attributes like 'mutates' in combination with arrangements (e.g., in loadRefAlt) operates as specified—consuming an extra stack value and rearranging return values appropriately.
   - Tests involving struct flattening for both simple structs (e.g., sumAB) and nested variants (e.g., addNested) confirm that parameters and return values are correctly flattened per the documentation.
   - Complex sequences of TVM instructions (as seen in tests like complexSequence, pushLargeNumber, pairAdd) and additional edge cases (including unknown instructions, improper mixing of literal primitives, parameter shadowing, empty asm bodies, and potential stack underflow situations) all produce expected outcomes matching the language specification.

**Conclusion:**

Every observed behavior from our extensive test suite—ranging from successful compilations under valid usage to clear and documented error messages when constraints are violated—is fully consistent with the official Tact documentation for asm functions. No significant compiler bug or mismatch between the compiler behavior and documentation was uncovered.
