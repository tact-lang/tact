/*
Next Phase: Continuing the Fuzz-Testing Cycle

Having comprehensively explored the full gamut of map-related features in Tact—including allowed key/value types, serialization modifiers, various insertion/retrieval/deletion/replacement operations, and both shallow and deep equality comparisons—we confirm that all observed behaviors match the documented specifications. There were no unexpected behaviors, internal compiler errors, or mismatches between the Tact documentation (e.g. see docs_book_maps.md  ) and compiler output.

With the map component now thoroughly validated, our fuzz-testing cycle continues without interruption. We will move on to testing additional compiler features. For example, the next phases of our exploration could target:

• Edge cases in assembly function declarations and their interaction with attributes such as `get` (as documented in assembly-functions.md).
• Detailed verification of state modifications within getter methods (in light of the note in contracts/#getter-functions about state modifications being non-persistent).
• Advanced behavior in the serialization of different cell types and their interactions with maps and complex data structures.

No significant flaws have been found in the maps component. The testing is ongoing and we persist until a definitive compiler bug or documentation discrepancy is confirmed.

End of Map Feature Fuzz-Testing; proceeding to further compiler features.
