All tests concerning allowed key and value types, serialization behavior, core operations (insertion, querying, update, deletion), nested maps and iteration constraints, and equality comparisons behaved as documented. Specifically, maps with keys of type Int and Address compiled correctly while any attempt to use disallowed key types (e.g., String or Structs) was correctly rejected. Serialized maps (e.g., using Int as uint8) and modifications (replace, replaceGet, del) function exactly as described. Additionally, shallow equality (==) and deep equality (deepEquals) comparisons behave as expected. No discrepancies or compiler bugs were found.";
