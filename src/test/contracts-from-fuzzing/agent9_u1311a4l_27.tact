// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Report on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact
// 
// Summary:
// After an exhaustive fuzz-testing cycle focusing on bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality, the following observations were made:
// 
// 1. Standard Bounce Receivers: 
//    - Defining a bounce receiver with a custom message type (e.g., bounced<MyMessage>) compiles successfully, matching the documented expectations.
// 
// 2. Invalid Declarations: 
//    - Bounce receivers using improper parameter types such as Int or Cell, or those declared without parameters, correctly trigger compile-time errors. The errors clearly state that only bounced<T>, message types, or Slice are supported.
// 
// 3. Fallback Behavior:
//    - Declaring a bounce receiver with a Slice parameter (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiles without issue, enabling contracts to catch all bounced messages.
// 
// 4. State Modifications: 
//    - State updates within bounce receivers (for example, incrementing a counter) are permitted and function as expected, in contrast to getter functions which do not allow state modifications.
// 
// 5. Receiver Conflict Enforcement:
//    - Attempting to declare multiple bounce receivers for the same message type results in a conflict error, ensuring a single, unambiguous receiver per type.
// 
// 6. Advanced Error Handling: 
//    - Incorporating try-catch blocks within bounce receivers compiles successfully with proper syntax, demonstrating that error recovery mechanisms are supported in these contexts.
// 
// 7. Recursive and Cross-Contract Operations:
//    - Scenarios involving recursive bounce handling (using self.reply() or self.notify()) and cross-contract bounce message flows compile and behave in accordance with the official documentation.
// 
// 8. Message Size Constraints: 
//    - Attempts to manipulate bounced message payloads beyond the 224 usable data bits limit correctly trigger compile-time errors, confirming that the compiler enforces this documented limitation.
// 
// Conclusion:
// All fuzz-testing experiments confirmed that the Tact compilerâ€™s handling of bounced messages and bounce receivers strictly adheres to the documented specifications. No discrepancies, bugs, or undocumented behaviors were uncovered.
// 
// The fuzz-testing cycle for this feature is thus successful, and further testing will continue with other language features in subsequent cycles.
