// Summary of asm functions comprehensive testing

// This test suite covers several edge cases related to asm functions:
// 1. Basic functionality: push42, add, swap operations confirm that TVM instructions (PUSHINT, ADD, SWAP) work as intended.
// 2. Arrangement handling: swap_pair exercises the argument/return arrangement (asm(arg2 arg1 -> 1 0)) and confirms that the flattened return type mapping works per documentation.
// 3. Error detection: the non-consuming primitive snippet (with just 43) and direct parameter usage (x in body) trigger expected compilation errors, matching the documentation that primitives must immediately follow a consuming instruction and parameters must not be interpreted as TVM instructions.
// 4. Nested structure flattening: sum_nested verifies that nested structs are flattened in the correct order on the stack (first field at bottom, last field on top).
// 5. Behavior without return types (noReturn) shows that asm functions not capturing a return value do not alter compile-time behavior.
// 6. Inline attribute: inlineTest confirms that the 'inline' attribute is effectively a no-op for asm functions as they are always inlined.
// 7. Mutates attribute: our test with 'asm mutates' produced the expected compilation error that mutates functions must also be declared as extend functions, which is aligned with the documentation enforcement.
// 8. Stack instructions: dropTest, getDepth, and double confirm that TVM instructions like DROP, DEPTH, DUP, and ADD operate as intended in the assembly environment.

// All tests compiled as expected or failed with the correct error messages related to misuse cases, and behavior aligns with the documentation (see docs_book_assembly-functions.md, e.g.,  ,  ).

// We did not uncover any deviations from the documented semantics for asm functions beyond already known issues. Further tests
// might explore extreme rearrangements or combined cases, but the current suite provides robust confirmation of documented functionality.

fun main() {
    // This main function serves as a placeholder; the compilation and linkage of the above asm functions
    // already demonstrate correct handling of TVM instructions and asm function specifics.
}
