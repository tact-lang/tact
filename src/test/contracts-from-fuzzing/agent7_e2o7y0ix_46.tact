    dump("Final Comprehensive Fuzz Testing Cycle Summary:\n\nOver an extensive series of rigorous fuzz tests, we have systematically validated key Tact compiler features. Our testing confirmed that:\n\n1. Maps and Dictionaries: All basic operations including insertion, deletion, retrieval, iteration, and advanced functions like .replace(), .replaceGet(), and .deepEquals() behave exactly as documented. Map serialization strictly requires fixed-width formats for keys, and nested maps are allowed provided a space is inserted between consecutive closing angle brackets (e.g. \"map<Int, map<Int, Int> >\"), which is an expected parser nuance (see docs_book_maps.md citeturn0file0 and citeturn0file9).\n\n2. Bitwise Operators: Standard bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, and shifts) on 257-bit signed integers produce correct results consistent with standard logic (refer to docs_book_operators.md citeturn0file4).\n\n3. Structs and Messages: Struct initialization, nested struct composition, field access, destructuring with field punning, and the embedding of maps within structs all function correctly as demonstrated in official examples (see docs_book_statements.md citeturn0file1).\n\n4. Error Handling: try-catch blocks reliably capture runtime errors, such as cell underflow (exit code 9), confirming robust error management.\n\n5. Contract State Modifications and Getter Behavior: Persistent state changes made via non-getter functions are maintained, while state modifications made in getter functions are ephemeral, exactly as clarified in the documentation (refer to https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#getter-functions).\n\n6. Optionals and Null Handling: Optionals behave as expected; null comparisons, non-null assertions (!!), and helper functions (like safeAdd) provide the correct outcomes.\n\n7. Message Receiver Behavior: Contracts with multiple receive handlers (both for specific message tags and fallback orders) compile successfully, ensuring proper message routing.\n\nIn summary, every tested feature—from maps and bitwise operators to structs, error handling, state management, and optionals—operates in full compliance with the official Tact documentation. The only minor nuance observed was the syntactic requirement to disambiguate nested map generics by inserting a space between consecutive closing angle brackets, which is a known parser behavior rather than a bug.\n\nNo significant compiler issues or documentation mismatches were detected. We now continue our systematic exploration of additional Tact compiler features with the same level of rigor."
