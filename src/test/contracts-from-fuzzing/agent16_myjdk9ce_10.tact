/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Report for asm Functions in Tact:

Scope: We targeted exhaustive testing of asm functions, focusing on arrangements, attribute interactions, and subtle edge cases. Known error cases were deliberately triggered (e.g., stray primitives, lowercase instructions, and parameter reference inside asm bodies), while valid constructs (multiple arrangements, extended functions with mutates attribute, multi-instruction bodies) were exercised.

Observations:
1. Correct assembly functions with valid arrangement declarations compile and behave per specification.
2. Error cases trigger appropriate compile-time errors as documented: 
   - Lowercase TVM instructions produce a syntax error.
   - Stray primitives without associated instructions yield errors.
   - Direct parameter references in asm bodies result in compile-time errors.
3. Complex arrangements (e.g., (2 1 0) for multi-argument functions) reorder the stack as expected, verified via function outputs.
4. The mutates attribute, when combined with proper return arrangements, enforces consumption of the extra stack value as outlined in documentation.

Conclusion:
Our persistent, rigorous exploration of asm functions has not revealed any significant compiler bugs or documentation mismatches beyond the already known issues. All edge cases tested behave in accordance with the documentation. We will continue further fuzzing other features following a similar systematic approach.
