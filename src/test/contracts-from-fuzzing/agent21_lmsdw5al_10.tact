// Fuzz-Testing Summary for initOf and Cross-Contract Relationships in Tact

/*
This comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle targeted the 'initOf' functionality and its role in cross-contract initialization
in Tact. We aimed to verify a variety of scenarios outlined in the official documentation (refer to docs_book_expressions.md  , docs_ref_core-addresses.md  ), including:

1. Simple Cross-Contract Initialization:
   - A parent contract calling initOf on a child, obtaining its StateInit and computing its contract address using contractAddress.

2. Multi-Level Parent-Child Relationships:
   - A hierarchical chain (GrandChild -> Child -> Parent), where each level initializes its child via initOf and computes the address.

3. Recursive Initialization:
   - A single contract invoking initOf on itself, testing self-referential initialization.

4. Mutual Recursive Initialization:
   - Two contracts (A and B) mutually invoking initOf on each other to check for proper resolution of circular dependencies.

5. Deep Nested Contract Graph:
   - A deep nesting of five levels (Level0 through Level4) to simulate a complex contract graph.

6. Parameterized Contracts:
   - Initialization of contracts with parameters via initOf, ensuring that the use of contract parameters is correctly handled.

For each scenario, minimal concise Tact code snippets were provided and compiled using the Tact compiler. 

Observed Results:
--------------------------------------------------
- All snippets compiled successfully without any error or unexpected behavior.
- The computed addresses via contractAddress (combined with initOf) aligned with the expected outcomes according to the documentation.
- Recursive and mutual recursive initializations, as well as deep nesting scenarios, were handled seamlessly by the compiler.
- No discrepancies, internal errors, or deviations from the documented specifications were observed.

Conclusion:
--------------------------------------------------
Based on this intensive cycle testing diverse complex and edge-case scenarios, the behavior of initOf and associated cross-contract relationships in Tact is consistent with the documentation. All tested cases performed as intended, validating that the current implementation adheres to the specifications provided in the official docs.
