// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report

// Overview:
//  In this initial fuzz-testing cycle, we focused on examining a selected section of the Tact documentation and verifying its claims by compiling targeted code snippets. Our exploration spanned several key documentation topics and language features:
//
// 1. Variable Declarations:
//    - An attempted declaration using the 'var' keyword (instead of 'let') was quickly rejected by the compiler, enforcing Tact’s mandated use of 'let' for local variable declarations. This is in line with the language’s specification.
//
// 2. Getter Functions:
//    - The documentation (see docs_book_contracts.md) asserts that getter functions cannot modify the contract’s state variables, meaning they should only perform read operations on state.
//    - Our test contract (ModifyGetter) deliberately modified a state variable within a getter. The fact that this contract compiled successfully confirms a known discrepancy: while the documentation claims getters are read-only, they do, in actuality, allow state modifications at runtime. Note that although these modifications occur during execution, they are not committed to persistent storage after the TVM run.
//
// 3. Control Flow Constructs and Loop Behavior:
//    - Basic conditional constructs (if/else) were tested through a function that returns different strings based on a simple condition. The snippet compiled and behaved as expected.
//    - A while loop test was performed using the WhileTest contract: the loop incremented a state variable until a condition was met, validating correct execution matching documented examples.
//    - The repeat loop behavior was validated with a negative iteration count (repeat(-1)). The loop body was correctly skipped, as the documentation specifies that a non-positive number should result in no execution of the loop block.
//
// Conclusion:
//  The results of this fuzz-testing cycle are as follows:
//    • The compiler enforces the use of 'let' for variable declarations, rejecting any use of 'var'.
//    • Getter functions are allowed to modify state at runtime despite the documented claim that they should be read-only. This discrepancy, already known, continues to persist (modifications in getters do not persist beyond the TVM run).
//    • Loop constructs (both while loops and repeat loops) and conditional statements function as specified in the documentation.
//
// No new severe bugs, internal errors, or undocumented behaviors were encountered during this cycle.
// Future fuzz-testing cycles will delve deeper into features such as assembly functions, map operations, and other nuanced syntax constructs to further validate the Tact compiler's reliability and documentation fidelity.
