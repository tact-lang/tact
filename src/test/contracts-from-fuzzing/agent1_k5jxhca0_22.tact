// Final Answer:

/*
Our rigorous fuzz-testing cycle of asm functions in Tact has thoroughly validated the documented behavior:

1. Basic asm functions (e.g., "asm fun answer(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }") compile successfully, confirming that valid TVM instructions are recognized as expected.

2. Primitives that are not immediately consumed by an instruction (e.g., "43" in "asm fun bad(): Int { 43 }") are correctly rejected, in accordance with documentation [ ].

3. Return arrangements work as documented. For instance, our swapInts function using "asm(-> 1 0)" properly reorders return values. Importantly, when a function returns a single value, only return index 0 is allowed – attempts to specify alternate indices (as in our asmStoreDict test) produce a specific error. This nuance, though logical given a single-value return, might benefit from enhanced discussion in the docs (see details in our Test 12 error message).

4. Parameter flattening is in line with expectations: structs and nested structs are flattened in order (see tests with sumAB and addNested) [ ].

5. Directly referencing parameter names within an asm body is disallowed and correctly flagged as an error, confirming the intended isolation between parameter usage and TVM instructions.

6. TVM instructions are case-sensitive; using lower-case (e.g., "pushint") triggers a compilation error, matching the documented requirement that instructions must be in UPPER CASE [ ].

7. Enclosing a TVM instruction in quotes, which turns it into a string literal, does not supply a valid opcode, again conforming with expected behavior.

8. The inline keyword is not allowed with asm functions even though they are inherently inlined. This rejection confirms that inline attributes are redundant in this context.

9. Mutation asm functions properly consume an extra stack value (for self); our loadMyRef test confirms that behavior in line with the documentation on mutates and stack consumption [ ].

10. Additional tests using various TVM instructions (DEPTH, SWAP, DROP, arithmetic operations, immediate arguments, negative numbers) demonstrate the compiler’s adherence to the documented stack manipulation rules.

Overall, no significant compiler bugs or documentation mismatches were found. All observed behaviors align with the official Tact documentation, with the only subtle nuance being the constraint in return arrangements for single-value functions – a detail that, while expected, might be underscored in future documentation revisions.

This comprehensive cycle not only affirms the Tact asm functions implementation but also reinforces the robustness of the compiler’s error checking and stack management in accordance with specifications.
