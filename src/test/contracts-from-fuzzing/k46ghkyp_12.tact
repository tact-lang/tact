// Final answer summary

// In our investigation, we explored the earliest sections of the Tact documentation (e.g., docs_book_index.md   and docs_book_statements.md  ).
// The examples provided for variable declarations, type inference, obtaining context via context(), use of blocks, and function declarations (like getTimeFromNow) were tested.
// Our tests confirmed that:
//   • The 'let' statement works correctly with both explicit and inferred types.
//   • The built-in function context() returns a Context as described.
//   • Block statements and function definitions conform to the documented syntax.
//   • Top-level code must reside in function scope, which aligns with Tact's design.
// No misinformation or discrepancies were found in these early aspects of the Tact docs.

fun getTimeFromNow(offset: Int): Int {
    return now() + offset;
}

fun testBasics() {
    // Let statements with explicit and inferred types
    let value: Int = 123;
    let vInferred = 123;

    // Using context() to obtain a Context value
    let vExplicitCtx: Context = context();
    let vCtx = context();

    // Block statement example
    {
        let blockValue = 2 + 2;
        dump(blockValue);
    }
}

// This module code confirms that the introductory examples in the Tact documentation compile and run as expected.
