/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
In this fuzz-testing cycle, we rigorously examined the implementation, documentation, and behavior of maps in Tact. Our investigation focused on verifying several critical aspects according to the official documentation:

1. Allowed Key Types:
   - Only the types Int and Address are permitted as keys. We confirmed this by compiling valid snippets (e.g. map<Int, Int> and map<Address, Int>) and ensuring that attempts to use disallowed types (like String or Struct) correctly yield compile-time errors.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   - Maps are allowed to hold values of types such as Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types. Our tests, including those with explicit serialization (e.g. map<Int as uint8, Int as uint8>), verified that serialization is supported only for Int types, aligning perfectly with the documentation.

3. Core Map Operations:
   - We thoroughly validated operations like insertion (.set), querying (.get and .exists), updating (.replace and .replaceGet), and deletion (.del or by setting a key’s value to null). In every case, the operations behaved as specified in the official Tact guides.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration:
   - Nested maps were tested by encapsulating an inner map within a struct (e.g. AllowanceMap) stored in an outer map keyed by Address. Iteration via foreach works only with maps referenced as valid path expressions (e.g. self.data) and yields compile-time errors when attempted on non-path expressions. This constraint was met as documented.

5. Equality Comparisons:
   - Lastly, our tests distinguished between shallow equality (using the '==' operator, which compares underlying cell hashes) and deep equality (using .deepEquals(), which performs an entry-by-entry comparison). The results confirmed that both methods work as described.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle confirmed that:
   • The Tact compiler enforces allowed key types (only Int and Address), rejecting any invalid types.
   • Allowed value types and serialization behavior work precisely as specified.
   • All core map operations (insertion, querying, modification, deletion) operate correctly.
   • Nested maps and iteration constraints are rigorously enforced.
   • Shallow vs. deep equality comparisons are clearly distinguished, with deepEquals incurring higher gas costs as documented.

No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were observed during our comprehensive tests. The Tact maps feature adheres exactly to the official documentation.
