/*
Our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle for bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact has confirmed that the Tact compiler behaves exactly as documented. We designed and compiled a broad suite of tests that cover standard, complex, and edge-case scenarios, including:

1. Minimal typed bounce receivers (using parameters of type bounced<MyMessage>) compile and are dispatched correctly.

2. Bounce receivers that use a raw Slice parameter work as expected—allowed operations (such as converting a Slice to a String with asString()) succeed according to the documentation of Slice operations.

3. In self-bouncing scenarios, a contract can send a bounceable message (using myAddress()) to itself, and its bounced receiver properly processes the bounce by issuing a reply (via self.reply), matching the official examples.

4. More advanced, recursive bouncing scenarios demonstrate that bounceable messages routed to external addresses and then bounced are correctly handled by raw Slice receivers which can trigger further actions.

5. When a contract declares both a typed bounce receiver and a fallback raw Slice bounce receiver, the compiler correctly prefers the more specific typed receiver.

6. State modifications within bounce receivers (such as incrementing persistent variables) are permitted and compile successfully, confirming that runtime bounce handlers may modify state—despite the restriction that getter functions are not allowed to change state.

Every test compiled successfully and behaved as expected, with no discrepancies or mismatches between the documentation and the actual compiler behavior.

Conclusion: The Tact compiler’s bounce message and bounce receiver functionalities are robust, reliable, and fully aligned with the official documentation. The behavior observed in all tests confirms that standard and complex use cases are handled correctly, with no known issues or deviations.
