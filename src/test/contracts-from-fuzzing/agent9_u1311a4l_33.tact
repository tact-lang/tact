// Final Answer: Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Summary for Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact
// 
// Our exhaustive fuzz-testing cycle examined numerous aspects of bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts. The key findings are as follows:
// 
// 1. Standard Usage:
//    • Bounce receivers declared with a custom message type (e.g., bounced<MyMessage>) compile successfully, verifying that the basic usage adheres to the documented guidelines (refer to docs_book_bounced.md).
// 
// 2. Invalid Declarations:
//    • Bounce receivers defined with an invalid parameter type (such as Int or Cell) or declared without a parameter produce clear compile-time errors. The error messages enforce that only bounced<T>, message types, or Slice are acceptable, which exactly matches documented constraints.
// 
// 3. Fallback Behavior:
//    • Contracts can implement fallback bounce receivers using a Slice parameter (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) to catch all bounced messages, and these compile without issue as described in the official documentation.
// 
// 4. State Modifications:
//    • Bounce receivers were shown to be able to modify contract state (e.g., incrementing a counter), indicating that unlike getter functions, bounce receivers can perform state updates. This is consistent with the docs on contract receiver functions (see docs_book_contracts.md).
// 
// 5. Conflict Prevention:
//    • Attempts to define multiple bounce receivers for the same message type correctly lead to conflict errors, ensuring that each message type has a unique handler, in line with language specifications.
// 
// 6. Advanced Error Handling and Recursive Operations:
//    • Incorporation of try-catch blocks within bounce receivers (with proper syntax) and using self.reply()/self.notify() for recursive or cross-contract message handling, compile and behave as documented. This demonstrates that advanced control flow constructs are supported and function as expected (also illustrated in docs_book_send.md).
// 
// 7. Message Size Enforcement:
//    • Tests that attempt to alter bounced messages in ways that exceed the 224 usable data bits limit result in the appropriate compile-time error, confirming strict adherence to this limitation imposed by the underlying blockchain specifications.
// 
// Conclusion:
// 
// All fuzz-testing experiments—including standard, edge-case, and error-inducing scenarios—validated that the Tact compiler’s handling of bounced messages and bounce receivers fully conforms to the official documentation. No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were observed in this feature area.
// 
// This confirms that bounce receiver functionality is robust and correctly implemented in Tact, as detailed in the official resources (see docs_book_bounced.md, docs_book_contracts.md, and docs_book_send.md).
// 
// The fuzz-testing cycle for bounced messages is complete with no identified issues, and further testing will proceed to other language features.
