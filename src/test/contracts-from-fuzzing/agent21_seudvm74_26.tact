// Continuing Fuzz-Testing Cycle

/*
After completing an extensive and rigorous fuzz-testing cycle focusing on bounce message handling and advanced error management, our tests have validated:

- That runtime errors (e.g. division-by-zero, invalid logarithm base) within bounced message handlers are correctly captured by try-catch blocks, with nested try-catch structures propagating inner errors as expected.

- That bounce message recursion conforms to the documented payload size constraints by using appropriately narrow integer types (e.g. serialization as uint64), ensuring that the available 224 data bits are not exceeded.

- All our tests in these domains have behaved consistently with the official Tact documentation, with no discrepancies or severe compiler bugs found in these features.

We now continue our systematic fuzzing by shifting our focus to further complex interactions:

1. Testing intricate interactions between different message-sending modes (such as SendRemainingValue and SendRemainingBalance) in multi-contract scenarios to verify that state updates and balances respect the documented behavior.

2. Exploring fallback receivers and raw Slice-based message handling to assess how unrecognized message types are processed and to observe any edge cases related to unexpected payload formats.

3. Investigating scenarios where receiver functions (including getters and external receivers) interact with persistent state updates, especially when state modifications occur near boundary values determined by serialization (for example, when using `Int as uint8` or similar types).

4. Combining contract parameters with delayed initialization features to ensure that overlapping configurations trigger the correct compile-time or runtime errors.

Our next series of tests will be designed to target these areas, aiming to expose any subtle edge cases or inconsistencies between Tact documentation and compiler behavior. We remain persistent and committed to a comprehensive and deep exploration of all Tact compiler features.

No significant bugs or documentation mismatches have been found in the bounce and error handling functionalities so far; we now move on to additional domains for further fuzz testing.
