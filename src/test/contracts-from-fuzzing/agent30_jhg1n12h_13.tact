// Summary: Fuzz-testing of bounced messages and bounce receivers
// ================================================================
// We embarked on a series of compilation tests to check the behavior of bounced messages
// and bounce receiver functionalities in various scenarios as documented in the official
// Tact language documentation. Below is a brief summary of our findings via multiple tests.

// Test Overview:
// 1. Basic Bounce with Typed Bounced Receiver
// ------------------------------------------------
// BounceTestEmpty contract successfully compiles. Its receive function sends a bounceable
// message and its bounced receiver correctly accepts a bounced<EmptyMsg> message and
// modifies the state accordingly. This is compliant with the documentation (see docs_book_bounced.md).

// 2. Fallback Bounced Receiver Handling all Bounce Replies as raw Slice
// ------------------------------------------------
// BounceFallback contract uses a fallback bounced receiver (accepting a raw Slice) and
// updates internal state. This too compiles correctly and is in line with documented behavior.

// 3. Disallowed Type in Bounced Receiver Parameter
// ------------------------------------------------
// We attempted to define a bounced receiver with a String parameter (BounceTextTest) but
// uncommenting that block produced a compilation error. This confirms that only bounced<T>
// where T is a struct type is allowed, as documented.

// 4. Multi-level Bouncing Scenario
// ------------------------------------------------
// BounceSender, BounceReceiverMissing contracts were used to test an outbound message
// bouncing due to an unresponsive recipient. The bounced receiver of BounceSender compiles
// successfully and handles bounced<SmallMsg> messages as per documentation.

// 5. Chained Bounce Reactions
// ------------------------------------------------
// ChainBounce contract, in combination with ChainNonResponder, illustrates a scenario where
// multiple bounce events trigger sequential outbound messages. It compiles correctly and
// enforces state modifications with each bounce event, exactly as expected.

// Additional Notes:
// - The compiler enforces the 224-byte limitation on bounced message types, rejecting types that
//   exceed this bound (evidenced by our earlier test with BouncedMsg having an overly large field).
// - The tests confirm that both typed bounced receivers and fallback receivers behave as documented.
// - No unexpected behavior or compiler errors were observed (aside from the intended, documented
//   restrictions), and all tests validate the official documentation regarding bounced messages.

// Conclusion:
// All tests passed and behaved in accordance with the documented rules for bounced messages and
// bounce receivers. No compiler bugs or documentation mismatches were found in these scenarios.

// End of Fuzz-Testing Cycle
