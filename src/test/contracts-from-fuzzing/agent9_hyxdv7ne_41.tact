Final Fuzz Testing Summary for asm Functions in Tact:

Our comprehensive fuzz testing cycle of asm functions was designed to thoroughly test every documented aspect and subtle edge case, while strictly avoiding known issues. Over 25 distinct test cases were developed and executed. The key findings include:

1. **Basic Functionality:**
   - Minimal asm functions compile correctly, for example:

         asm fun push42(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }

     This confirms that numeric primitives paired with their TVM instructions function as documented (see citeturn0file8 for details on TVM instruction usage).

2. **Error Conditions:**
   - Using a bare primitive without an accompanying TVM instruction (e.g.,

         asm fun badPrimitive(): Int { 43 }

     ) produces clear compile-time errors as specified in the documentation. Likewise, attempting to directly reference parameters within the asm body (e.g.,

         asm fun echo(x: Int): Int { x }

     ) also yields errors, which is consistent with the explanations provided (see citeturn0file7).

3. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - TVM instructions are case-sensitive. Our tests revealed that lowercase mnemonics (e.g.,

         asm fun wrongCase(): Cell { mycode }

     ) are rejected, while properly upper-cased versions (e.g.,

         asm fun rightCase(): Cell { MYCODE }

     ) compile if the instruction is defined, aligning with documented rules (see citeturn0file14).

4. **Return Rearrangement:**
   - Invalid return rearrangement syntax (such as using indices beyond the valid range) triggers explicit error messages—for example, an error like "asm return rearrangement must mention only valid return position numbers: [0..0]" was observed when an arrangement (-> 1 0) was improperly used in a function returning a single value. Correcting the arrangement (e.g., using (-> 0)) results in successful compilation, confirming that the compiler enforces stack rearrangement rules as documented (see citeturn0file4).

5. **Advanced Features & Edge Cases:**
   - Combined features such as the use of the 'mutates' attribute with arrangements (e.g., in loadRefAlt), struct flattening for both simple and nested structures (e.g., sumAB, addNested), and sequences of TVM instructions (such as in complexSequence, pushLargeNumber, pairAdd) exhibit behavior that is entirely in line with the documentation (refer to citeturn0file2 and citeturn0file12).
   - Additional tests—including those for unknown instructions, improper mixing of literal primitives with TVM instructions, parameter name collisions, empty asm bodies, and stack underflow scenarios—produce expected errors or outcomes.

**Conclusion:**

Our extensive fuzz testing confirms that the Tact compiler’s behavior regarding asm functions is robust and completely aligned with the official documentation. All observed behaviors—whether successful compilations or explicit compile-time errors—match the documented specifications. No significant compiler bug or documentation mismatch was uncovered.
