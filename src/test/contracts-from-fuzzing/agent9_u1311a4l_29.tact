Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact

Overview:
----------
Our deep fuzz-testing cycle on bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts was designed to rigorously validate the behavior of these constructs against the official Tact documentation.

Key Areas Tested:
-------------------
1. Standard Bounce Receiver Usage:
   - Using bounce receivers with a custom message type, e.g.,
       bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
     compiled successfully, confirming expected behavior as outlined in the documentation.

2. Invalid Receiver Declarations:
   - Bounce receivers declared with invalid parameter types (e.g., Int, Cell) or with no parameters produced clear compile-time errors. This verifies that only bounced<T>, message, or Slice types are accepted, exactly as documented.

3. Fallback Handling via Slice:
   - Bounce receivers defined with a Slice parameter (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiled and function as a catch-all for bounced messages.

4. State Modifications in Bounce Receivers:
   - Testing state updates (e.g., increasing a counter) within bounce receivers showed that state modifications are properly allowed—a key difference from getter functions which cannot modify state.

5. Conflict Resolution:
   - Attempts to define multiple bounce receivers for the same message type correctly resulted in conflict errors, enforcing the documented rule of a unique handler per message type.

6. Advanced Control Flow with Try-Catch:
   - Incorporating try-catch within bounce receivers (with proper syntax) compiled successfully, demonstrating supported error handling.

7. Recursive & Cross-Contract Operations:
   - Complex scenarios involving recursive bounce handling with calls to self.reply() and self.notify(), as well as cross-contract bounce propagation, were verified to compile and behave in line with documentation.

8. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
   - A test that attempted to operate on a bounced message when its data field exceeded the 224-bit usable limit produced an appropriate compile-time error, confirming the strict enforcement of this limitation as per documentation.

Conclusion:
-----------
Every test—ranging from standard valid use cases to nuanced edge cases—ran as expected without discrepancies between the documentation and the compiler's behavior. The bounce receiver feature is robust and aligns perfectly with documented specifications.

Next Steps:
-----------
The fuzz-testing cycle for bounced messages is now complete. No anomalies or deviations have been observed; hence, further fuzz-testing will now move on to other features of the Tact language. The process remains active and persistent.
