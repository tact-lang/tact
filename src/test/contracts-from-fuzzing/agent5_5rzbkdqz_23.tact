/*
Fuzz-testing summary:

We have rigorously and exhaustively exercised the asm functions feature using a broad range of test cases, targeting subtle and intricate edge cases such as:

- Valid usage (e.g., basic constant pushes, arithmetic operations, and valid TVM instruction sequencing).
- Parameter handling and struct flattening (including nested structs and the requirement that parameter arrangements must reference all parameters without duplication).
- Attribute usage (inline, extends, mutates) and enforcement of constraints such as reserved names and ordering.
- Return arrangement limitations (ensuring that return arrangements reference valid stack register positions based on the declared return type).
- Handling of extraneous tokens, extraneous primitives, and unknown TVM instructions.
- Complex stack manipulation sequences using DUP, SWAP, DROP, and addition operations.
- Enforcement of contextual restrictions including the disallowance of asm functions defined within contracts.

In all cases, each test produced the expected outcome:

• Valid code compiled successfully and behaved as documented.
• Code intentionally violating documented rules (such as duplicate parameters in arrangement, orphan primitives, invalid attribute usage, and reserved parameter names) generated the expected compile-time errors.
• Tests simulating potential runtime errors (e.g., stack underflow due to extra DROP operations) compile fine, with runtime errors occurring only during execution as intended.

No new significant compiler bugs or discrepancies between the compiler behavior and the official Tact documentation were detected beyond the already documented issues.

We continue exercising additional extreme and borderline cases. However, at this stage, our thorough exploration of asm functions has confirmed that aside from the known inconsistencies (already documented), the current compiler behavior faithfully aligns with its specification as described in the official documentation (see docs_book_assembly-functions.md  ,  , and others).

This concludes our current exhaustive fuzz-testing iteration on asm functions. The process remains active, and we will persist in exploring further aspects of the compiler if new topics emerge.
