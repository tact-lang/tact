Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Maps in Tact

Introduction:
------------
In this comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle, we extensively examined the implementation and behavior of maps (dictionaries) in Tact by creating and compiling many minimal code snippets. Our focus was on confirming the following aspects as described in the official Tact documentation (see   for the overview of maps):

1. Allowed Key Types:
   - The documentation confirms that valid key types are restricted to Int and Address. This was verified by:
     • A successful test using map<Int, Int> and map<Address, Int> (TestMapValid, TestAddressKey).
     • Rejection of invalid key types such as String and user-defined Structs (TestInvalidKey, TestStructKey), which failed as expected with a clear error message (see  ).

2. Allowed Value Types and Serialization:
   - Allowed value types include Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types (Structs, Message). We also confirmed serialization support for Int keys/values (as in TestSerializedMap). Notably, the documentation states (see  ) that while map keys may employ fixed-width serialization formats, other allowed key types do not support serialization, and our tests confirmed that serialized maps work as documented.

3. Map Operations:
   - The provided operations (.set, .get, .exists, .replace, .replaceGet, .del) performed exactly as defined in the documentation (see   and  ). For example:
     • Insertion via .set, deletion (both by .del and using null with .set), and replacement operations returned the correct values / booleans as expected (TestMapOps and TestMapSummary).
     • Shallow equality (using '==') and deep equality (using .deepEquals) behaved as described in the documentation, showing that while shallow equality compares serialized hashes, deepEquals compares entry-by-entry (TestMapDeepEquals).

4. Nested Maps and Iteration:
   - We explored nested maps by wrapping an inner map in a struct (AllowanceMap) and using an outer map keyed by Address (TestNestedMapsIteration). Iteration via foreach was accepted only when the map was referenced as a valid path expression (such as self.data) and rejected when attempted over results of function calls. This behavior aligns with the restrictions mentioned in the documentation (see  ).

5. Edge Cases and Boolean Value Handling:
   - Map values of type Bool were also tested to ensure that conditional logic (if statements) can correctly evaluate map-stored Boolean values, as confirmed by TestMapBoolFixed. Minor syntactical adjustments were needed, but ultimately, the behavior was in line with expectations.

Conclusion:
-----------
All tested scenarios confirmed that the Tact compiler behaves according to the official documentation regarding maps. Key types are strictly enforced (only Int and Address are allowed), and all map operations—including insertion, deletion, querying, and replacement—perform as documented. Moreover, serialization and iteration restrictions are enforced as described. 

There was no discrepancy found between the documented specifications and the actual behavior of the compiler with respect to maps.
