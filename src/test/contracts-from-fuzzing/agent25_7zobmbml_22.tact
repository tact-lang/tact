Final Answer:
---------------
Our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle for bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact confirms that the compiler behaves exactly as documented. We carried out numerous tests covering both straightforward and subtle scenarios:

1. A minimal typed bounce receiver (using a parameter of type bounced<MyMessage>) compiled successfully, showing that bounced messages are correctly dispatched to designated handler functions—as described in the official documentation (docs_book_bounced.md citeturn0file0).

2. Bounce receivers declared with a raw Slice parameter also compiled correctly. In our tests, we performed allowed Slice operations (like using asString(), as detailed in docs_book_cells.md citeturn0file0), which confirms that generic bounce handlers extract data properly.

3. In a self-bouncing scenario, a contract sent a bounceable message using myAddress() (refer to docs_ref_core-contextstate.md) and its bounced receiver triggered a self.reply, as expected by messaging examples (see docs_ref_core-send.md citeturn0file1).

4. More complex, recursive bouncing was simulated successfully: a bounceable message to an external address, upon bouncing, was processed by a natural raw Slice bounce receiver, which then issued a reply. This verifies support for multi-level bounce scenarios.

5. When both a typed and a raw Slice bounce receiver were declared in one contract, the compiler correctly resolved the conflict by favoring the more specific typed receiver—exactly as per Tact’s design.

6. Importantly, tests involving state modifications inside bounce receivers (e.g., incrementing a counter) confirmed that runtime bounce handlers may modify state and trigger additional actions (using self.reply), which is consistent with the documentation clarifications (see docs_book_contracts.md citeturn0file2).

In summary, all our tests compiled and behaved as expected. There are no discrepancies between the documented behavior and the actual operation of bounced messages and bounce receivers in the Tact compiler.

Conclusion: The Tact compiler’s bounce receiver functionality is robust, reliable, and fully consistent with its official documentation—standard bounce handling, conflict resolution, and allowed state modifications are all executed as expected.
