/// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Summary

/*
Summary:
---------
We began our cycle by targeting several sections from the Tact documentation. Our focus was on:

1. Contract Constants: 
   - TestConst1 illustrates that compile-time constant expressions (e.g., 1+2) are accepted by the compiler; the getter function accessing such a constant compiles successfully.
   - TestConst2 (not in the aggregated valid tests) uses now() in constant initialization, which correctly fails with an error, confirming that only compile-time evaluable expressions are allowed in constant initialization. This aligns with Tact documentation regarding constant expressions.

2. Getter Functions Modifying State:
   - Documentation [Getter functions]( ) states that getters cannot modify state variables. Our test (GetterTest) compiles even though the getter function does modify the state variable during runtime. This confirms the known nuance: getters may modify state internally while such changes are not persisted after the TVM run. This highlights a slight misalignment between the documentation and the actual compiler behavior.

3. Wildcard Variable (_):
   - The attempt to access a variable declared with underscore (_) produces a compilation error, which matches the documentation for let statements regarding unused/wildcard variables.

4. Standard let statement and type inference tests compile successfully.

Overall, our comprehensive cycle confirms that:
- Compile-time constant usage is strictly enforced.
- Getter functions modifying state are accepted, though their effects are ephemeral, which is a documented nuance but still represents a small documentation mismatch.
- Variable scoping with _ is enforced properly by the compiler.

These findings will help ensure consistency between the official documentation and the compiler's behavior, and further fuzz-testing will continue to scrutinize other language features.
