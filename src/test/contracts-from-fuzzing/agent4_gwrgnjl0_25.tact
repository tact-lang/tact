Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
In this comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle, we examined the implementation, documentation, and behavior of maps in Tact—focusing on allowed key and value types, serialization methods, core operations (insertion, deletion, updating, querying), nested map usage, iteration constraints, and equality comparisons.

Documentation Context:
----------------------
The official Tact documentation for maps [ ] states that:
• Allowed key types: only Int and Address are permitted.
• Allowed value types: Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types (structs/messages) are allowed (provided they meet context conditions).
• Only Int-typed keys (and values) support serialization (e.g. Int as uint8) [ ].
• Map operations such as .set(), .get(), .exists(), .replace(), .replaceGet(), and .del() behave with specific semantics, and equality comparisons differentiate shallow equality (using ==, which compares underlying cell hashes) versus deep equality (.deepEquals) that performs entry-by-entry comparisons [ ].

Testing Summary:
----------------
1. Allowed Key Types:
   - Valid maps using Int (TestMapValid) and Address (TestAddressKey) compile and operate correctly.
   - Attempts to use invalid key types (e.g. String in TestInvalidKey or a Struct in TestStructKey) correctly produce compile-time errors, thus enforcing documentation restrictions.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   - Maps with value types such as Int, Bool, and serialized Int (e.g. TestSerializedMap) compile and perform as expected, confirming that serialization is applied only to Int types.

3. Core Map Operations:
   - Operations (insertion via .set, querying via .get and .exists, updates via .replace and .replaceGet, deletion via .del or assigning null) perform exactly as documented. Our TestMapOps and TestMapSummary tests verified that these methods return appropriate values and update the map state correctly.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration:
   - Nested maps were successfully implemented by encapsulating an inner map within a struct (AllowanceMap) and storing it in an outer map keyed by Address. Iteration using foreach works provided the map is referenced as a valid path expression (as in self.data), and attempts to iterate over non-path expressions are correctly rejected.

5. Equality Comparisons:
   - Our tests confirmed that shallow equality (using ‘==’) compares the underlying serialized cell hashes, while deep equality (using .deepEquals) compares the actual map entries. These behaviors align with the documentation.

6. Boolean Map Values:
   - A test with Bool values (TestMapBoolFixed) confirmed that maps can store Bool values and be used within conditional statements after minor syntax adjustments, as expected.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our exhaustive fuzz-testing cycle shows that the Tact compiler's implementation of maps is fully consistent with the official documentation. Key and value type restrictions, serialization rules, core operations, nested map handling, iteration constraints, and equality comparisons all behave as documented without discrepancies or bugs. No anomalies or mismatches were found during our tests.
