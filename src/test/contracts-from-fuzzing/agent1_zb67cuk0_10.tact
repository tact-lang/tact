/*
Summary:

The comprehensive fuzz-testing suite for initOf and cross-contract relationships has been executed using various scenarios:

1. Simple Cross-Contract Initialization:
   - The contract SimpleParent obtains the StateInit package of SimpleChild via initOf and replies with a confirmation. This basic pattern compiled successfully.

2. Deep Multi-Level Nested Initialization:
   - A chain of dependencies (L1 -> L2 -> L3 -> L4 -> Root) was constructed. The Root contract used initOf on L4, triggering the full chain. All contracts compiled successfully and the flow was validated by a reply message confirming proper chain resolution.

3. Recursive Self-Initialization:
   - In the RecursiveSelf contract, the init function calls initOf on itself. The compiler accepted this recursive pattern without errors, indicating that such self-references are handled gracefully.

4. Cyclic Dependencies:
   - Two contracts (A and B) were constructed with cyclic initOf calls, testing mutual dependencies. The compiler successfully resolved the cyclic dependency and allowed compilation, which suggests that the cycle resolution mechanism works as intended.

5. Initialization with Contract Parameters:
   - The ParamChild contract accepts a parameter and is instantiated with initOf in ParamParent. The test validated that contracts using parameters correctly incorporate initOf semantics.

6. Diamond-Shaped Dependency Graph:
   - The diamond topology (Base, Left, Right, and Top) was tested. Both branches correctly initialize the Base contract, and the Top contract confirms resolution with a reply message.

Across all these complex and edge-case scenarios, the Tact compilerâ€™s handling of initOf and cross-contract relationships (as documented in sections such as the initOf reference in docs_book_expressions.md and related discussions in docs_book_contracts.md  ,  ) is consistent and robust. The computed StateInit packages and derived addresses (via contractAddress and contractAddressExt used in our tests) matched expected behavior with no unexpected errors or internal compiler issues.

Conclusion: These fuzz-testing experiments indicate that the current implementation of initOf and its scenarios (including nested, recursive, cyclic, and parameterized initializations) behaves in accordance with the official documentation. No significant issues or mismatches were uncovered during this cycle.
