/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
During this exhaustive fuzz-testing cycle, our aim was to rigorously validate the behavior and implementation of maps in Tact against the official documentation. Specifically, we focused on the following aspects:

1. Allowed Key Types:
   - Official documentation (e.g., see docs_book_maps.md   and  ) mandates that only Int and Address types can be used as keys for maps.
   - Our tests confirmed that maps declared as map<Int, Int> and map<Address, Int> compile as expected, while attempts to use disallowed key types (such as String or Structs) result in clear compile-time errors.

2. Allowed Value Types and Serialization:
   - The documentation lists allowed value types (Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types) and specifies that only integer types support serialization (e.g. using Int as uint8), as shown in docs_book_maps.md  .
   - Our tests with serialized maps (e.g., map<Int as uint8, Int as uint8>) and maps containing Boolean values validated that these features work exactly as documented.

3. Core Map Operations:
   - We examined fundamental operations including insertion (.set), querying (.get and .exists), updating (.replace and .replaceGet), and deletion (.del or setting a key to null).
   - The behavior of these operations, verified through multiple test snippets (e.g., TestMapOps and TestMapSummary), confirmed that they return correct boolean flags, previous values, and update state accurately in line with documentation expectations.

4. Nested Maps and Iteration Constraints:
   - Our tests also constructed nested maps (by embedding inner maps within structs, as shown in AllowanceMap examples) and verified that iteration using the foreach construct is permitted only when the map is referenced as a proper path expression (e.g., self.data). Attempts to iterate over maps that are not valid path expressions were correctly rejected.

5. Equality Comparisons:
   - An important distinction exists between shallow equality using the '==' operator (which compares underlying stored cell hashes) and deep equality using .deepEquals() (which performs a complete, entry-by-entry comparison).
   - Tests demonstrated that while shallow equality may yield false negatives when serialization details differ, deepEquals accurately compares map contents as advertised in the docs.

Conclusion:
-----------
All our tests and edge-case explorations confirm that the Tact compiler’s implementation of maps is fully consistent with the official documentation. In summary:

• Only allowed key types (Int and Address) are accepted; disallowed types are rejected at compile time.
• Allowed value types, including specialized serialization (for Int), operate as expected.
• Core map operations (insertion, querying, replacement, and deletion) function reliably according to specification.
• Nested maps can be used and iterated, provided that valid path expressions are maintained.
• Shallow and deep equality comparisons are distinctly and correctly implemented.

No discrepancies, unexpected behavior, or compiler bugs were identified in our testing cycle. The Tact maps feature behaves precisely as documented.
