Final Summary of Comprehensive Map Fuzz-Testing

During our extended fuzz-testing cycle for maps in Tact, we have rigorously explored a diverse set of features, including:

1. Basic Operations: Insertion, retrieval, and deletion have been validated using the primary map methods such as set(), get(), del(), and replace(). Replacement using replaceGet() has been shown to return the old value on successful update and null upon deletion (see docs_book_maps.md  ).

2. Equality Comparisons: We confirmed that while shallow equality using the == operator may yield false if the underlying cell hashes differ (due to insertion order variations), deepEquals() reliably returns true for two maps with equivalent entries regardless of order, in full agreement with the documented behavior (see docs_book_maps.md  ).

3. Arithmetic Key Evaluation: Map keys expressed as arithmetic expressions (e.g. 1/2, 2 + 2, negative and large integers) are processed using standard integer semantics. Our tests showed that integer division, sign preservation, and large numeric representations work as specified.

4. Serialization: By employing serialization modifiers (such as "as uint8") on map keys, we confirmed that the compact representations are stored and retrieved correctly. This validates the documentation on serialization and its intended benefits for space saving (see docs_book_maps.md  ).

5. Nested Maps: Embedding maps within structs (e.g. using an AllowanceMap struct with a nested map<ValueType>) was tested successfully. Our nested map retrieval returned the expected value, verifying the documentation’s guidelines on nested maps and their usage.

6. Iteration and Modification: Edge cases such as attempting to modify a map during iteration and iterating over non-path expressions (such as function call expressions) resulted in expected compilation errors, confirming that the compiler enforces restrictions as specified in the documentation (see docs_book_statements.md  ).

7. Error Conditions: Our negative tests—such as declaring maps with disallowed key types (e.g. using a struct) or iterating over maps returned by functions—indeed resulted in compiler errors. These test cases reinforce that the type restrictions documented for maps are actively enforced by the compiler.

Overall, our exhaustive testing of maps has confirmed that every documented claim regarding allowed key/value types, serialization, equality, replacement, nested maps, and iteration is accurately implemented by the Tact compiler. No significant deviations, compiler bugs, or documentation mismatches were detected.

We continue our systematic exploration of Tact’s compiler features with the same rigor, targeting further advanced and subtle aspects in subsequent fuzz-testing cycles.
