// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Report for Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality
// 
// Overview:
// This report presents the results of a thorough fuzz-testing cycle for bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts.
// Our testing procedure consisted of a systematic evaluation of various scenarios, including:
//   - Standard bounce receiver usage with custom message types (e.g., bounced<MyMessage>).
//   - Invalid parameter types in bounce receivers (e.g., using Int or Cell instead of bounced<T> or Slice), which correctly produced compile errors.
//   - Bounce receivers declared without parameters, which also failed to compile as expected.
//   - Fallback bounce receivers using Slice to capture all bounced messages.
//   - State modifications inside bounce receivers (e.g., a counter increment), verifying that state changes are allowed in this context.
//   - Conflict detection when multiple bounce receivers are declared for the same message type.
//   - Advanced control flow using try-catch within bounce receivers, with proper syntax adjustments.
//   - Recursive and cross-contract interactions involving bounced messages, such as sending replies using self.reply() and self.notify().
//   - Enforcement of the 224 usable data bit limit for bounced messages, which triggered a proper compile-time error when exceeded.
// 
// Key Documentation References:
//   - Bounced Messages and receiver functionality: docs_book_bounced.md  
//   - Contract receiver and state modification behaviors: docs_book_contracts.md  
//   - Outbound messaging and bounce handling: docs_book_send.md  
// 
// Detailed Findings:
// 
// 1. Valid Bounce Receiver Usage:
//    - A contract with a bounce receiver declared as: 
//          bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
//      compiled without issues, confirming that the basic syntax follows the documentation.
// 
// 2. Invalid Receiver Parameter Types:
//    - Using an invalid type (e.g., Int or Cell) in a bounce receiver led to compilation errors stating that only bounced<T>, message, or Slice are allowed.
//    - Omitting the parameter altogether also triggered expected errors.
// 
// 3. Fallback Receiver Functionality:
//    - Defining a bounce receiver with a Slice parameter (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiled successfully, allowing a contract to catch all bounced messages.
// 
// 4. State Modifications in Bounce Receivers:
//    - Bounce receivers were successfully used to modify contract state, such as incrementing a counter, demonstrating that state updates are permitted.
// 
// 5. Conflict Resolution:
//    - Defining two bounce receivers for the same message type generated a conflict error, enforcing the rule that only one bounce receiver per message type can exist.
// 
// 6. Advanced Control Flow with Try-Catch:
//    - After correcting a syntax error by adding a catch parameter, try-catch blocks within bounce receivers compiled correctly.
// 
// 7. Recursive and Cross-Contract Handling:
//    - Scenarios involving the use of self.reply() and self.notify() within bounce receivers compiled as expected, supporting complex chained interactions.
// 
// 8. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
//    - An attempt to modify a bounced message to exceed the 224-bit data limit resulted in a compile-time error, verifying that the compiler properly enforces message size constraints.
// 
// Conclusion:
// All tests were successful and aligned with the behavior described in the official Tact documentation. No discrepancies or compiler bugs were identified in the handling of bounced messages and bounce receivers.
// 
// End of report.
