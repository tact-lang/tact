Fuzz-testing Cycle Summary for initOf Functionality and Cross-Contract Relationships in Tact

Overview:
----------
We extensively tested the behavior of the initOf expression, along with its role in
computing contract initial state (StateInit) and deriving contract addresses (via contractAddress).

Test Scenarios Executed:
---------------------------
1. Simple Cross-Contract Initialization:
   - A simple child contract was initialized from a parent contract using initOf.
   - The parent's receiver function computed the StateInit and derived the correct address. (See docs: docs_ref_core-addresses.md, docs_book_expressions.md  ,  )

2. Multi-Level Parent-Child Relationships:
   - We constructed a hierarchy (GrandChild -> Child -> Parent).
   - Each layer successfully generated its child's StateInit and computed contract addresses.

3. Recursive Initialization:
   - A single contract invoked initOf on itself.
   - The snippet compiled successfully, demonstrating that self-referential initializations are processed correctly.

4. Mutual Recursive Initialization:
   - Two contracts mutually initialized one another using initOf.
   - Both contracts compiled successfully, indicating that circular references are resolved as per the current compiler behavior.

5. Deep Nested Contract Graph:
   - A deep nested structure (from Level0 up to Level4) was tested.
   - Every level used initOf and contractAddress correctly, with no errors, confirming that the compiler handles complex nested graphs.

6. Parameterized Contracts:
   - Contracts using parameters were initialized using initOf, both from within the contract and from an external caller.
   - All parameterized usage scenarios compiled as expected.

Conclusion:
-----------
All of the tested scenarios compiled without errors, and all outcomes align with the documented behavior of initOf and associated cross-contract functionalities.

Observations:
-------------
- The Tact compiler successfully resolved both recursive and mutual recursive initOf calls.
- Complex nested contract graphs behaved as anticipated.
- Parameterized contracts successfully integrated with initOf.

Thus, our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle confirms that the current implementation of initOf and cross-contract relationships strictly conforms to the official documentation (e.g., docs_book_expressions.md, docs_ref_core-addresses.md).

No discrepancies or bugs were observed during these tests.
