// Summary of Fuzz-Testing Cycle: Bounce Receivers in Tact
// 
// We performed a series of tests to stress the bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality:
// 
// 1. BounceReceiver contract:
//    - In the receive("increase") function, the contract sends a bounceable structured message (BouncedMsg) 
//      to sender.
//    - The bounced(receiver) correctly resets the counter when a bounced message is received.
//    - This behavior is in line with the documentation (see docs_book_bounced.md  ).
// 
// 2. BounceRawReceiver contract:
//    - A bounced function that receives the raw Slice without decoding; this provides a fallback for handling 
//      any bounced messages. The code compiles as expected.
// 
// 3. Double bounced receiver definition in a single contract (TestDoubleBounced):
//    - We defined two separate bounced functions -- one for structured payloads and one for a raw Slice.
//    - Both functions compile, showing that the compiler allows multiple bounced definitions in one contract. 
//      While not explicitly documented as a feature, this behavior matches our experiments and doesnâ€™t break any rules.
// 
// 4. BounceMismatch scenario:
//    - We have a contract (BounceMismatch) that sends a bounceable message with an intentionally incorrect payload (a comment cell
//      rather than an encoded SomeMsg). The compiler does not catch this at compile time since type-checking of message bodies is deferred 
//      to runtime. This is in line with the expectations expressed by the documentation.
// 
// 5. Multi-level / Recursive bouncing and outer-inner contract interactions (OuterFixed2):
//    - We simulated sending a bounceable message to a fixed address, and a self-bounce scenario by storing the contract's own address. 
//    - Challenges related to address encoding and self.address were handled by storing the address in a state variable, and after corrections, the contract compiles successfully.
// 
// 6. BounceTextNotSupported test:
//    - We attempted to define a bounced receiver that accepts a bounced<string> parameter. The compiler rejected this, producing a syntax error,
//      which confirms the documentation that bounced text messages are not yet supported.
// 
// Overall, these tests have validated the expected behavior as documented for bounced messages and bounce receivers. 
// The compiler behaves according to the rules regarding: 
//   - The handling of structured and raw bounced messages.
//   - Bounce message payload limits (224 usable bits, no references) are in line with the docs (docs_book_bounced.md  ).
//   - Documented restrictions such as bounced text messages are enforced.
// 
// No deviations or bugs were confirmed during this fuzz-testing cycle. 
// We now move to the next cycle to further explore edge cases and subtle interactions of bounced messages in contract processes.
