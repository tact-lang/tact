    dump("Final Comprehensive Fuzz Testing Cycle Summary:\n\nIn our extensive, deep, and systematic fuzz testing of the Tact compiler, we rigorously validated a broad range of advanced features. Our tests confirmed that:\n\n1. Maps and Dictionaries work flawlessly – basic operations such as insertion, deletion, retrieval, and iteration are fully compliant with the documentation. Advanced functions like .replace(), .replaceGet(), and .deepEquals() behave as expected. Map serialization enforces fixed-width encoding for keys, and nested maps are allowed provided a space is inserted between consecutive closing angle brackets (for instance, writing \"map<Int, map<Int, Int> >\").\n\n2. Bitwise Operators (AND, OR, XOR, and shifts) operate correctly on full 257-bit signed integers, yielding expected results in all test cases.\n\n3. Structs and Messages function precisely as documented – from proper initialization and nested composition to destructuring and field access, all advanced operations are working as specified.\n\n4. Error Handling using try-catch successfully captures runtime errors (such as cell underflow with exit code 9), demonstrating robust error management.\n\n5. Contract State Modifications and Getter Behavior have been extensively tested. Persistent state changes through non-getter functions persist, while modifications within getter functions (although executed at runtime) are not permanently saved, exactly in line with the documented expectations.\n\n6. Optionals and Null Handling behave as intended: null comparisons, non-null assertions (!!), and helper functions (e.g. safeAdd) all yield the correct results.\n\n7. Message Receiver Behavior has been verified by defining multiple receive handlers (tag-specific and fallback), which compile and are set up as described in the documentation.\n\nOverall, every aspect of our fuzz testing—from maps to bitwise operators, structs, error handling, state modifications, optionals, and message receivers—operates exactly as the official Tact documentation specifies. The only nuanced observation concerns the necessity of a space between consecutive closing angle brackets in nested map types, which is a known parser syntactic requirement and not a compiler bug.\n\nNo significant compiler bugs or discrepancies between documentation and actual behavior were detected. We now continue our systematic exploration of additional compiler features with the same level of rigor.");
