// Final Answer Summary for Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Testing in Tact

/*
Overview:

Our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle targeted the bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts. We systematically validated both typical scenarios and several non-obvious edge cases to ensure adherence to the documented behavior.

Key Areas Tested:

1. Valid Bounce Receiver Patterns:
   • Bounce receivers defined with the correct syntax—using the type wrapper (e.g., bounced(msg: bounced<PingMsg>))—compiled successfully. This confirms that the compiler enforces the required wrapping mechanism as described in the bounced messages documentation (see  ).
   • Fallback bounce receivers that use a raw Slice parameter (i.e., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) also compile, enabling the contract to capture all bounced messages regardless of type. This behavior aligns with the design intentions detailed in the contracts documentation (see  ).

2. Invalid Bounce Receiver Declarations:
   • When a bounce receiver is declared without the necessary bounced<T> wrapper (for example, using an unwrapped message type), the compiler reliably issues a compile-time error. This strictly enforces the required syntax as specified in the official documentation.
   • Attempts to access a non-existent field in a bounced message (e.g., referencing msg.x when the message only provides a field named value) correctly trigger a compile error, verifying proper type-safety measures.
   • Similarly, bounce receiver declarations for bounced text messages (e.g. bounced(msg: bounced<string>)) are disallowed, which is in full agreement with the documented limitation (bounced text messages are not supported).

3. Multi-Contract and Recursive Bouncing Scenarios:
   • We simulated a scenario where one contract (BounceChainA) sends a bounce-enabled message to another contract (BounceChainB) that deliberately lacks a receiver. As a result, the message bounces back to BounceChainA, and its bounce receiver correctly increments a counter. This recursive bouncing behavior confirms that messages follow the intended bouncing mechanism when not processed properly, as described in the docs (see   and  ).

Conclusion:

Our fuzz-tests validate that:
   - Valid bounce receiver implementations (both with typed bounced<T> parameters and fallback receivers using Slice) compile and operate exactly as documented.
   - Erroneous declarations (e.g., missing the bounced<T> wrapper, referencing non-existent fields, or using unsupported text message types) trigger the appropriate compile-time errors.
   - Multi-contract recursive bouncing behaves as expected, with messages bouncing back when not properly handled.

In summary, the Tact compiler’s treatment of bounced messages and bounce receivers is fully consistent with the official documentation. No deviations, discrepancies, or bugs were discovered during our rigorous testing.
