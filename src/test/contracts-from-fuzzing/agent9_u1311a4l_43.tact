// Comprehensive Final Answer: Fuzz-Testing of Bounced Messages and Bounce Receivers in Tact

/*
Final Summary Report:
---------------------
Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle examined multiple aspects of bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts. We generated a series of minimal code snippets to exercise both normal use and a wide range of edge cases. Below is the final summary of our findings:

1. Standard Bounce Receiver Usage:
   • A bounce receiver declared with a custom message type, for example:
         bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
     compiles successfully. This confirms that the basic usage exactly matches the documentation (refer to docs_book_bounced.md).

2. Invalid Receiver Declarations:
   • Bounce receivers declared with an invalid parameter type (e.g., Int or Cell) or without a parameter produce explicit compile-time errors. The error messages enforce that only types of the form bounced<T>, message, or Slice are allowed, which concurs with the language specifications (see docs_book_contracts.md).

3. Fallback Handling:
   • Bounce receivers accepting a raw Slice (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compile without issue, thereby offering a valid catch-all mechanism to process any bounced message.

4. State Modifications:
   • Our tests show that bounce receivers can modify contract state (e.g., incrementing a counter), which is expected and contrasts with read-only getter functions.

5. Unique Receiver Enforcement:
   • Attempts to define multiple bounce receivers for the same message type trigger conflict errors, ensuring a one-to-one mapping between message types and receivers.

6. Advanced Control Flow:
   • Incorporating try-catch blocks (with proper syntax) in bounce receivers compiled successfully. Additionally, recursive and inter-contract scenarios (using self.reply() and self.notify()) behave consistently with the official guidelines (see docs_book_send.md).

7. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
   • Tests that attempted to process bounced messages with payloads exceeding the 224 usable data bits limit resulted in compile-time errors, confirming strict adherence to this documented constraint.

Conclusion:
-----------
Every test, ranging from standard valid usage to aggressive edge cases, confirmed that the Tact compiler’s behavior for bounced messages and bounce receivers is fully compliant with the official documentation. No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were discovered in this feature area.

This rigorous fuzz-testing cycle verifies that the implementation is robust, and further cycles will extend to additional Tact features. The current outcome establishes a high degree of confidence in the bounce handling mechanisms as prescribed by the Tact language.
