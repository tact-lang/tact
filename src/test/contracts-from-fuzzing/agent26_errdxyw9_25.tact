Fuzz-Testing Cycle: initOf Functionality and Cross-Contract Relationships

Objective:
This testing cycle aimed at exhaustively validating the documented behavior of the initOf expression along with cross-contract relationships including:
- Simple cross-contract initialization
- Multi-level and hierarchical contract relationships
- Complex and nested dependency graphs
- Recursive and circular initialization patterns
- Parameter passing (with trailing commas) and type enforcement
- Integration with address computation functions (contractAddress, newAddress), etc.

Methodology:
A series of over 20 comprehensive and creative Tact code snippets were developed and compiled. Each snippet targeted distinct and subtle edge cases as described in the official documentation (refer to docs_book_expressions.md, docs_ref_core-addresses.md, and related sections).

Key Observations:
1. Simple and multi-level initialization tests successfully compiled and returned valid StateInit structures, consistent with documentation.

2. Complex dependency graphs, where multiple initOf calls were composed within structs, behaved as expected. The computed addresses (via contractAddress) were consistent with runtime addresses (via myAddress).

3. Recursive usage (initOf on self) and circular dependencies between contracts did not trigger any internal compiler errors, confirming that initOf is a compile-time construct and is evaluated appropriately.

4. Parameter handling with trailing commas worked as documented, and type safety checks enforced the correct types. Deliberate misuse (e.g., passing a String where an Int is expected) produced the correct compile-time error.

5. Inline functions using initOf required self-qualification as expected, and once corrected behaved correctly.

Conclusion:
All tests compiled and behaved consistently with the official Tact documentation. No significant discrepancies, unexpected outputs, or compiler bugs have been observed in any configuration of initOf or its integration with cross-contract relationships.

Next Steps:
The fuzz-testing continues to explore other compiler features and subtle edge cases. However, regarding initOf functionality and cross-contract relationships, the behavior is fully consistent with documentation.
