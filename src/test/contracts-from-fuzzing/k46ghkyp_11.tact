// Final answer snippet: validation of earliest Tact docs

// In our investigation, we started by searching the earliest documented sections in the Tact docs (see docs_book_index.md   and docs_book_statements.md  ).
// Based on the examples provided in the Tact Book and Statements sections, we validated several fundamental constructs:
//   • The 'let' statement work, both with explicit types and type inference.
//   • The built-in function context() correctly yields a Context structure.
//   • Block statements work as described (allowing a final semicolon to be optional).
//   • Top-level function declarations like getTimeFromNow compile as expected.

fun getTimeFromNow(offset: Int): Int {
    return now() + offset;
}

fun testBasics() {
    // Testing let declarations (from docs_book_statements.md)
    let value: Int = 123;
    let vInferred = 123;

    // Retrieving execution context as seen in the docs
    let vExplicitCtx: Context = context();
    let vCtx = context();

    // Demonstrating block usage
    {
        let blockValue = 2 + 2;
        dump(blockValue);
    }
}

// Explanation:
// These examples reflect the introductory concepts detailed in the earliest parts of the Tact documentation.
// The documentation shows that variable declarations, context retrieval, and block syntax are as expected. 
// Our experiments using compile_snippet confirm that these claims are accurate and compile successfully.
// No discrepancies or misinformation were found regarding these constructs.
