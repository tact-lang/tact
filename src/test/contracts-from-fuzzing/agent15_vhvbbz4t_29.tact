// Summary:
// This extensive fuzzing cycle for maps has systematically tested:
// • Standard operations: set, get, replace, replaceGet, del, exists, isEmpty, deepEquals, asCell
// • Iteration behaviors, including discarding keys, modifying within foreach, nested iteration and order
// • Allowed key/value types including Int, Address, and even message types
// • Serialization of keys/values when declared in structs
// • Local (non-persistent) maps usage
// In all cases, the compiler behavior adhered to its documentation and no unexpected behavior or significant bug was found.
// Continuing exploration of other Tact features remains essential, but the map-type operations appear robust according to our tests.
