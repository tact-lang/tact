// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Summary
//
// We have selected an arbitrary section of the Tact documentation related to contracts, getter functions, receiver functions, and attributes.
// 
// Tests performed:
// 1. Tested a standard getter function that reads a state variable. (TestGetter) - it compiled successfully.
//
// 2. Tested a getter function that attempts to modify a state variable (TestGetterModify). 
//    Although documentation states that getters "cannot modify" state variables, the compiler compiled this snippet without an error. 
//    This aligns with documented observations that state modifications in getters are not preserved beyond runtime.
//
// 3. Verified that mixing contract parameters with an explicit init() function (StillParam) yields a compilation error as documented.
//
// 4. Tested assembly functions with the "get" attribute (illegalGetter): the snippet compiled successfully, which is a known discrepancy with documentation. 
//    This behavior has been flagged previously; we avoid further reporting on known issues.
//
// 5. Tested receiver functions including bounced and external receivers. 
//    Initially, a bounced function using an undefined type produced an error, and after defining the type (MsBounced), compilation succeeded.
//
// 6. Verified that assembly functions cannot be declared as virtual outside of contracts/traits (invalidAsm) - the compiler produced the expected error.
//
// 7. Additionally, we tested an interface declaration via @interface, which compiled successfully.
//
// Summary:
// The tests confirm expected behaviors in terms of documentation compliance for getter functions, contract parameter usage, and function attributes, aside from known discrepancies (e.g., state modifications in getters and the allowance of the get attribute in assembly functions).
//
// No new severe compiler bugs or documentation misinformation were detected in this cycle.
