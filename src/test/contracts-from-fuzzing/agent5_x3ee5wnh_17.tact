// Summary of Fuzz-Testing Cycle
// 
// Our fuzz-testing cycle began by selecting the interface and control-flow constructs described in the Tact documentation. We began by exploring the documentation sections on getter functions, try-catch, if statements, ternary expressions, and assembly functions (see docs_book_statements.md   and docs_book_contracts.md   for context).

// 1. Try-Catch Constructs:
// We initiated our tests with various try-catch scenarios, including a simple error throw/catch block, nested try-catch, and conditionally re-throwing errors. Our tests confirmed that the try-catch mechanism correctly catches thrown errors and that nested try-catch semantics roll back the code executed in the try block when an error is caught.

fun simpleTryCatchTest() : Int {
    try {
         // Throw an error
         throw(42);
    } catch (e) {
         // Return the error code augmented
         return e + 1;
    }
    // Unreachable code, safe to omit in typical usage
    // return 100;
}

// 2. Conditional Constructs:
// We tested if-else chains and ternary expressions using minimal representative snippets. The tests verified that nested if-else branches behave as documented, and the ternary operator (`?:`) correctly chooses between alternatives as expected.

fun nestedIfTest(x: Int) : Int {
    if (x < 0) {
         return 0;
    } else if (x == 0) {
         return 1;
    } else {
         return 2;
    }
}

fun ternaryTest(x: Int) : Int {
    return (x > 5) ? (x * 2) : (x + 2);
}

// 3. Assembly Functions:
// We verified that assembly functions function properly with the sample snippet that returns the current stack DEPTH, which compiled as expected (see docs_book_assembly-functions.md  ).

asm fun myAsm() : Int {
    DEPTH
}

// 4. Getter Functions and State Modifications:
// Although documentation states that getters should only read state, our test confirmed that state modifications (such as increment operations) in getters are allowed at runtime, even if those modifications are not persisted after the TVM run. This aligns with the observed behavior as the changes are effective only in the runtime of the getter call. See docs_book_contracts.md   for reference.

contract TestGetter {
    x: Int;
    
    init() {
         self.x = 10;
    }
    
    // Getter that intentionally modifies the state variable. 
    // Even though documentation suggests getters are for reading, runtime modifications occur but are not persisted in storage.
    get fun getAndInc() : Int {
         self.x = self.x + 1;
         return self.x;
    }
}

// Note: When invoking such a getter from an external call, the modified value will be computed but not persistently stored.
// Additional tests can invoke this getter within the same Tact call to observe the updated runtime value.

// 5. Combined Tests with Try-Catch, Conditionals, and Nested Constructs:
// We attempted more sophisticated combinations, like nested try-catch with conditionals. Although some nested constructs produced unreachable code warnings (which the compiler flags appropriately), modifying the structure to remove unreachable statements resulted in expected behavior.

fun complexTryTest(v: Int) : Int {
    try {
         if (v < 0) {
              throw(42);
         } else {
              return v + 1;
         }
    } catch (e) {
         return e + 100;
    }
}

fun main() : Int {
    // Running a suite of tests for various constructs:

    let tryTestResult: Int = simpleTryCatchTest();  // Expected: 43
    let ifResult: Int = nestedIfTest(10);             // Expected: 2
    let ternaryResult: Int = ternaryTest(7);            // Expected: 14
    let asmResult: Int = myAsm();                       // Returns current stack depth.
    let complexResult: Int = complexTryTest(-10);       // Expected: 142

    // We return one of the tests as an example; in production, these can be aggregated or used in debugging.
    return tryTestResult;
}
