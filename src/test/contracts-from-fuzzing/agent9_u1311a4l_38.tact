// Comprehensive Final Answer

/*
Final Summary:
-------------
Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle on bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality confirms that the Tact compiler operates in strict adherence to the official documentation. The key findings are summarized below:

1. Standard Bounce Receiver Usage:
   • A bounce receiver declared with a custom message type (e.g., using:
       bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
     ) compiles successfully, which validates the basic, documented usage (refer to docs_book_bounced.md).

2. Invalid Declarations:
   • Bounce receivers defined with incorrect parameter types (e.g., Int or Cell) or those without any parameter properly trigger compile-time errors. The error messages enforce that only types of the form bounced<T>, message, or Slice are permitted, exactly matching the documentation.

3. Fallback Behavior:
   • Bounce receivers that accept a raw Slice (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compile without issue, providing a catch-all mechanism for handling bounced messages as documented.

4. State Modifications:
   • Testing confirmed that bounce receivers are allowed to alter contract state (e.g., increment a counter), supplying essential flexibility unavailable in getter functions yet consistent with overall receiver behavior (see docs_book_contracts.md).

5. Duplicate Receiver Prevention:
   • Attempts to declare multiple bounce receivers for the same message type result in a conflict error, ensuring a one-to-one mapping between message types and their handlers as required by language specifications.

6. Advanced Control Flow:
   • Incorporation of error handling constructs (using try-catch with proper syntax) and scenarios involving recursive or cross-contract bounce handling (via self.reply() or self.notify()) compile and function as expected, demonstrating support for complex control flow in bounced message contexts.

7. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
   • When operations on bounced messages attempt to exceed the 224 usable data bits limit, the compiler correctly emits a compile-time error. This strict enforcement matches the documented limitation as described in docs_book_bounced.md.

Conclusion:
-----------
Each test—ranging from valid standard scenarios to deliberately invalid and edge cases—has confirmed that the Tact compiler’s behavior aligns perfectly with the official documentation. No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were observed in this feature area.

The robust implementation of bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact was verified, and further fuzz-testing cycles will now focus on additional language features.
