/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
Over the course of this fuzz-testing cycle, we rigorously examined Tact maps by validating their documented behavior against the actual compiler implementations. Our investigation focused in depth on key and value types, serialization options, core map operations, nested map usage and iteration constraints, as well as shallow vs. deep equality comparisons.

Documentation Reference:
------------------------
According to the official Tact documentation (see docs_book_maps.md and related operator sections in docs_book_operators.md):

• Allowed key types: Only Int and Address are permitted. Our tests confirmed that maps declared as map<Int, Int> and map<Address, Int> compile and behave correctly, while attempts to use disallowed key types (e.g. String or custom Structs) result in compile-time errors.

• Allowed value types: Maps may store Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types. Serialization support is provided only for integer types (e.g. Int as uint8) to optimize storage. Tests using serialized maps (map<Int as uint8, Int as uint8>) along with maps storing Bool values confirmed that these constraints are enforced accurately.

• Core map operations: Insertion (.set), querying (.get and .exists), updating (.replace and .replaceGet), and deletion (.del or null assignments) were tested extensively. In every instance, the operations performed exactly as specified in the documentation. For example, replacing a key’s value returns the previous entry or a boolean flag as appropriate.

• Nested maps & iteration: We constructed nested maps by embedding an inner map within a struct (termed AllowanceMap) and stored it in an outer map keyed by Address. Iteration using foreach is allowed only when the map is accessed through a valid path expression (e.g., self.data) and is rejected when attempted on maps returned by function calls. Our test cases confirmed these exact restrictions.

• Equality comparisons: The Tact language supports both shallow equality (using the '==' operator, which compares underlying cell hashes) and deep equality (using .deepEquals(), which performs an element-by-element comparison). Our tests verified that these operators behave distinctly as documented, with deepEquals offering a thorough, though gas-expensive, comparison.

Testing Summary:
----------------
1. Allowed Key Types:
   - Valid examples using Int and Address as keys compile correctly (e.g., TestMapValid, TestAddressKey).
   - Attempts to use disallowed keys such as String or Structs are correctly rejected by the compiler (as demonstrated in TestInvalidKey and TestStructKey).

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   - Maps holding Int, Bool and serialized Int values compile and return expected results (as validated in TestSerializedMap and TestMapBoolFixed).

3. Core Map Operations:
   - Insertion, query, replacement, and deletion operations behave precisely as expected. For instance, performing m.replace() or m.replaceGet() on existing keys returns the correct responses. 

4. Nested Maps & Iteration Constraints:
   - Nested maps are supported, but iteration via foreach is only permitted when the map is referenced through valid path expressions (e.g., self.data). Attempts to iterate on maps produced from function calls are rejected, thereby enforcing documentation requirements.

5. Equality Comparisons:
   - Shallow equality (==) compares map cell hashes whereas deep equality (deepEquals()) performs a detailed, entry-wise comparison. Our experiments confirmed this behavior, including noticeable differences upon modifying map entries.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our systematic fuzz-testing demonstrated that the Tact compiler enforces all documented constraints on maps:
   • Key types are restricted solely to Int and Address.
   • Value types, including support for serialization on integer types, conform to documentation.
   • Standard map operations (insertion, querying, updating, deletion) function exactly as advertised.
   • Nested maps are supported under well-defined iteration constraints.
   • Shallow (==) and deep (.deepEquals()) equality comparisons are clearly and correctly differentiated.

No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were found during our testing cycle. Through extensive compilation tests and carefully designed minimal code samples, we confirmed that Tact maps operate robustly and precisely as documented, ensuring reliability and consistency for developers.

Return Value: 0 (indicating all map-related tests passed successfully).
