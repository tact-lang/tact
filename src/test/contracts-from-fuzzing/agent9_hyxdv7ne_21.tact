// Final summary: Extended asm functions fuzz testing
// 
// Our extensive and systematic fuzz testing of assembly (asm) functions in Tact covered a wide set of edge cases, including:
// 
// 1. Valid minimal asm functions (e.g., push42) that compile successfully, confirming that numeric primitives accompanied by TVM instructions (like PUSHINT) work as documented. [ ]
// 
// 2. Incorrect usage such as a primitive number without an accompanying TVM instruction (badPrimitive) triggered compile-time errors, in line with documentation on primitives in asm functions. [ ]
// 
// 3. Direct reference to parameters in the asm function body (echo(x)) resulted in errors because parameter names are parsed as TVM instructions, as specified in the docs. [ ]
// 
// 4. Case sensitivity tests confirmed that using lower-case TVM instruction names (wrongCase) leads to errors, while proper upper-case usage (rightCase) compiles (subject to the availability of the instruction). [ ]
// 
// 5. Return rearrangement tests validated that invalid arrangements (like using indices beyond the range for functions with a single return value) produce clear compile-time errors, while correcting them (swapSubCorrected) compiles as expected. [ ]
// 
// 6. Tests involving the mutates attribute with arrangements (loadRefAlt) verified that the required extra stack consumption and arrangements function as per the documentation. [ ]
// 
// 7. Struct flattening tests (e.g., sumAB, addNested, nested struct tests) confirmed that the compiler properly flattens structs for parameter passing and return value capturing. [ ]
// 
// 8. Tests for unknown instructions (unknownInstruction) and mixing constants without instructions (mixedPrimitiveOrder) produced the expected errors.
// 
// 9. Additional tests using complex sequences of TVM instructions, multiple rearrangements, and parameter shadowing (conflictParam, shadowParam, pairAdd) further stressed the asm function parser. In each case, errors or successful compilations aligned with the Tact documentation.
// 
// In conclusion, none of our extensive and persistent tests uncovered any significant compiler bug or contradiction between the Tact documentation and actual compiler behavior. The observed errors were precise, accurate, and conformed to documented behavior. 
// 
// Our fuzz testing of asm functions in Tact is thus successful and shows no unresolved discrepancies at this point.
