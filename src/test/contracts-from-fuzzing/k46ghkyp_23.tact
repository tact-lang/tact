// Final Answer Summary:

/*
Our investigation began by examining the earliest sections of the Tact documentation (e.g., docs_book_index.md and docs_book_statements.md), which introduce the fundamental constructs of the language.

Key points validated include:

1. Variable Declarations: The 'let' statement works as documented. Both explicit type annotations (e.g., let value: Int = 123) and inferred types (e.g., let vInferred = 123) compile correctly.

2. Built-in Functions: Using the built-in function context() correctly returns a Context value as described in the documentation.

3. Block Statements: Blocks grouped by braces, with an optional trailing semicolon, compile as expected.

4. Function Declarations: Module-level functions (such as getTimeFromNow) compile successfully. Additionally, attempting to declare variables outside of function scope produces a compilation error, which is the intended behavior per Tactâ€™s design.

Our comprehensive testing confirms that these foundational constructs, as presented in the early Tact docs, compile and behave according to the documentation. No misinformation, bugs, or discrepancies were detected.

Citations:
- The overview provided in docs_book_index.md introduces the Tact Book and its core themes.
- The detailed examples in docs_book_statements.md demonstrate the use of let statements, block statements, and functions.

Conclusion: The initial documentation of Tact is accurate, and our tests confirm that these features compile as expected.

fun testBasics() {
    // Testing explicit and inferred let declarations
    let value: Int = 123;
    let vInferred = 123;

    // Testing the context() function
    let vExplicitCtx: Context = context();
    let vCtx = context();

    // Testing a block statement
    {
        let blockValue = 2 + 2;
        dump(blockValue);
    }
}
