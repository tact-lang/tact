// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Report

// Summary:
// This cycle of fuzz-testing focused on verifying various sections of the Tact documentation, particularly the behavior of getter functions, loop constructs, variable declarations, and control flow statements.
//
// Key Observations:
// 1. Variable Declarations:
//    - An attempt to use 'var' resulted in a compilation error, confirming that only 'let' is supported for variable declarations in Tact.
//
// 2. Getter Functions:
//    - While the documentation explicitly states that getters cannot modify the contract’s state (they’re supposed to only read state values), our test contract in which a getter function assigned a new value to a state variable compiled successfully.
//    - This confirms the previously noted discrepancy: getters can modify state at runtime, but such modifications do not persist after the TVM run. This is a known and documented behavior.
//
// 3. Loop Constructs and Conditionals:
//    - The while loop that increments a state variable until a condition is met compiled and ran as expected.
//    - The repeat loop was tested with a negative iteration count (repeat (-1)) to verify that execution of the loop body is skipped, and this behaved as documented.
//    - Basic if/else conditionals also compiled successfully and conform to the provided documentation examples.
//
// Conclusion:
//
// During this comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle, no new severe issues were identified. The behavior of variable declarations, getter functions, loops, and conditionals align with expectations from the documentation—with the known discrepancy regarding state modifications in getter functions verified.
//
// Next steps include probing further into other features (e.g., deeper control flow, assembly functions, map operations) to ensure the robustness of the compiler.
