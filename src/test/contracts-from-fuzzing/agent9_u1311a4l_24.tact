// Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Testing Outcome Report

// Summary:
// We have conducted an extensive fuzz-testing cycle targeting the bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts. In order to ensure complete coverage, our tests included both standard valid use cases and numerous edge cases, as well as error validation tests for invalid syntax and type usage.

// Key Findings:
// 1. Standard Usage:
//    - A bounce receiver declared with a custom message type, such as:
//         bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
//      compiled successfully, confirming that the basic usage conforms to the official guidelines (see docs_book_bounced.md  ).

// 2. Invalid Bounce Receiver Signatures:
//    - Tests using parameters of invalid types like Int or Cell correctly triggered compile-time errors. The compiler clearly reported that only bounced<T>, message types, or Slice are allowed. Similarly, omitting a parameter yielded an error. This behavior is consistent with documentation.

// 3. Fallback Receiver Behavior:
//    - A bounce receiver accepting a Slice (fallback for all bounced messages) compiled without issues, which is exactly as documented (refer to docs_book_bounced.md   and docs_book_contracts.md  ).

// 4. State Modification in Bounce Receivers:
//    - Bounce receiver functions that perform state updates (e.g. updating a counter) work as expected. This aligns with our testing results that show state modifications are permitted in bounce receivers even though getter functions are restricted.

// 5. Receiver Conflict Handling:
//    - Attempting to define two bounce receivers for the same message type triggered the expected conflict error, thereby enforcing unique handling per message type.

// 6. Advanced Constructs and Error Handling:
//    - Incorporating try-catch blocks within a bounce receiver (after a minor syntax fix) compiled successfully, demonstrating that error recovery can be embedded in bounced message handling.

// 7. Recursive and Cross-Contract Operations:
//    - Complex scenarios that chain bounce receivers using self.reply() or self.notify(), as well as cross-contract bounce message flows, compiled and behaved in accordance with the official Tact documentation (see docs_book_send.md   and related references).

// 8. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
//    - A test case attempting to modify a bounced messageâ€™s payload in a manner that exceeded the 224 usable data bits led to a compile-time error. This confirms that the compiler properly enforces the message size limitation disclosed in the documentation (docs_book_bounced.md  ).

// Conclusion:
// Our exhaustive fuzz-testing cycle across varied scenarios and edge cases has validated that the Tact compiler's handling of bounced messages and bounce receivers adheres strictly to the documented specifications. No discrepancies or unanticipated behaviors were detected.

// Next Steps:
// The fuzz-testing cycle will continue further into other language features. This phase, however, conclusively demonstrates that the bounce receiver implementation is robust and correctly aligned with official expectations.

// End of Report.
