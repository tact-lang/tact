// Final Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report
//
// Overview:
// We initiated a fuzz-testing cycle by reviewing an arbitrary section of the official Tact documentation. Specifically, we focused on:
//   • Variable declarations (ensuring only 'let' is allowed).
//   • Getter functions as defined in contract documentation and their behavior regarding state modifications.
//   • Control flow constructs (if/else, while loops, repeat loops) and their documented behavior.
//
// Key Findings:
// 1. Variable Declarations:
//    - An attempt to use 'var' instead of 'let' was rejected. This behavior enforces the language rule that only 'let' is allowed, as illustrated in the documentation (see docs_book_statements.md  ).
//
// 2. Getter Functions:
//    - The documentation (docs_book_contracts.md  ) asserts that getter functions cannot modify contract state. However, our test involving a getter that assigns to a state variable (in contract ModifyGetter) compiled successfully. This confirms a known discrepancy: getters can perform state modifications at runtime even if those changes are non-persistent beyond the TVM run.
//
// 3. Control Flow & Loop Constructs:
//    - Conditional statements (if/else) compiled and behaved as expected based on documentation (referenced in docs_book_statements.md  ).
//    - A while loop test (WhileTest contract) confirmed that loops increment state variables until a condition is met. This matches documented examples in the Tact Book.
//    - A repeat loop test with a negative iteration count (repeat(-1)) confirmed the loop body is skipped when provided a non-positive integer, as specified in the docs.
//
// Conclusion:
//   • All tested language features behave as documented, with the sole notable discrepancy being that getter functions are allowed runtime modifications to state, despite the read-only claim in the documentation. This is a known issue and does not represent a new bug. 
//   • No new severe issues, internal errors, or compiler bugs were identified in this cycle.
//
// Next Steps:
// We will continue our fuzz-testing by exploring further aspects of the Tact language, including assembly functions and map operations, to ensure that the compiler behavior remains consistent with the documentation or to identify any additional mismatches.
//
// This completes our current comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle.
