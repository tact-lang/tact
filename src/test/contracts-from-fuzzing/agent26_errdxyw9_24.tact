// Final Summary of Fuzz-Testing Results for initOf and Cross-Contract Relations
//
// Over the course of our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle for the initOf expression and related cross-contract interactions, we constructed and compiled over 20 distinct test cases. These tests targeted subtle edge cases and intricate configurations, including:
//
// 1. Simple initialization: One contract (e.g., A) and another that calls initOf A (as seen in our very first tests). This confirmed that retrieving the StateInit works as expected when assemblies and contract parameters are used without issues.
//
// 2. Multi-level hierarchical relationships: Parent-Child relationships were tested with parameter passing (including trailing commas) according to the documented syntax (see docs_book_expressions.md for initOf examples). Our Parent and Child contracts successfully compiled and returned the expected StateInit structures.
//
// 3. Complex dependency graphs: We built tests that combine multiple initOf calls (e.g., CombinedDeps, DoubleRef) and even nested them inside structs to verify that the computed StateInit values can be composed reliably. Each test produced a well-formed StateInit structure
//
// 4. Recursive and circular dependencies: By invoking initOf on the same contract (Recursion, RecursiveGetter) and through two contracts calling each other (CircA and CircB), we verified that the compiler computes the contract’s initial state without triggering internal errors. These tests are consistent with the design of initOf as a compile-time construct (see docs_book_expressions.md).
//
// 5. Integration with address computation: Several tests combined initOf with contractAddress (and newAddress) so as to verify that the computed contract addresses (obtained via contractAddress(initOf ...)) coincide with runtime addresses (myAddress()). This behavior is documented in the addresses reference (e.g., docs_ref_core-addresses.md) and was confirmed by our tests.
//
// 6. Type safety and erroneous parameter passing: Our tests intentionally passed wrong parameter types (e.g., passing a String to an Int) to ensure that the compiler raises compile-time errors. These errors correspond exactly to the documented expectations, enforcing the static type constraints of Tact.
//
// 7. Inline usage: In tests for inline functions (InlineInit), we verified that function calls require self-qualification when necessary. After correcting the misuse, the expected behavior ensued.
//
// Throughout all of these tests, every snippet that was intended to compile did so, and misuse cases produced compile-time errors as expected. No unexpected behavior, internal compiler errors, or deviations from the official documentation have been detected.
//
// References:
// • The detailed behavior of initOf is described in the expressions documentation (see docs_book_expressions.md, particularly the initOf section).
// • The computation of contract addresses using the state init package is documented in docs_ref_core-addresses.md.
//
// Conclusion:
// Our exhaustive fuzzing and systematic testing of the initOf functionality, including its complex interactions in multi-level and circular contract graphs, indicate that the Tact compiler behaves consistently with the official documentation. No evidence of a compiler bug or documentation mismatch has been found in this cycle.
//
// We will persist in further exploration of other compiler features, but regarding initOf and cross-contract relationships, our tests confirm correct behavior.
