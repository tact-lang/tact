// Final Summary of Fuzz Testing Cycle on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality

/*
This fuzz testing cycle concentrated on verifying that the Tact compiler’s handling of bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality aligns with the official documentation. Our tests, guided primarily by the documentation in citeturn0file0 (Bounced messages) and citeturn0file3 (Receiver functions in contracts), included the following scenarios:

1. Standard Bounce Receiver (Typed):
   - We implemented a bounce receiver by wrapping the message type in bounced<T> (e.g., bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>)).
   - The snippet compiled without issues, confirming the documented behavior.

2. Bounce Receiver with Raw Slice:
   - We also tested a bounce receiver that directly accepts a raw Slice (i.e., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)).
   - This variant compiled successfully, as documented.

3. Incorrect Bounce Receiver Declaration:
   - A deliberately misdeclared bounce receiver (using bounced(msg: MyMessage) without wrapping the type) produced a compile-time error, which is expected since the documentation requires the parameter to be wrapped in bounced<...>.

4. Recursive Bounce Simulation:
   - We implemented a contract (RecursiveBounce) that simulates recursive bouncing by sending a bounce message from within its own bounced receiver. A counter was used to limit recursion and avoid infinite loops. This snippet compiled without issue, showing that recursive bounce handling is supported if managed properly.

5. Address Literal Strictness:
   - An attempt to use an invalid address literal (0:0) was rejected. Correcting it using a dummy but valid address (with proper formatting) allowed the snippet to compile, confirming the Tact compiler’s strict evaluation of constant address literals.

In conclusion, our comprehensive testing confirmed that:
   • The bounce receiver syntax (both typed via bounced<T> and raw Slice variants) is enforced and works as described in the documentation.
   • Incorrect declarations are caught at compile time, ensuring consistency.
   • Recursive bounce handling is supported provided that safeguards (like counters) are implemented by the developer.
   • Constant evaluation for addresses meets the documented constraints.

All observed behavior is consistent with the official specifications and no significant discrepancies were found during this fuzz-testing cycle.
