// Final Answer Summary for Bounced Message and Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Testing in Tact

/*
Final Summary:

Our extensive fuzz-testing cycle specifically focused on bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts demonstrates full consistency between the Tact compiler behavior and the official documentation.

Key observations are as follows:

1. Valid Bounce Receiver Patterns:
   - Bounce receivers properly declared with the syntax (e.g., using the wrapper: bounced(msg: bounced<PingMsg>)) compile and behave as expected. This confirms that the compiler enforces the requirement that messages be wrapped in a specific type constructor, as described in the bounced messages documentation (see  ).
   - A fallback bounce receiver using a raw Slice parameter (i.e., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) also compiles, serving as a catch-all for bounced messages. This behavior aligns with the design outlined in the receiver functions documentation (refer to  ).

2. Invalid Bounce Receiver Declarations:
   - Attempts to declare a bounce receiver parameter without the required bounced<T> wrapper reliably trigger compile-time errors, enforcing the documented syntax restrictions.
   - Attempts to access non-existent fields (e.g., referencing msg.x when only msg.value exists) also produce expected type errors, ensuring strict type safety.
   - Additionally, declarations using unsupported types (such as a bounced text type, e.g., bounced(msg: bounced<string>)) are appropriately rejected by the compiler.

3. Multi-Contract and Recursive Bouncing Scenarios:
   - We simulated a scenario where one contract (BounceChainA) sends a bounce-enabled message to another contract (BounceChainB) that lacks a receiver. The message correctly bounces back to BounceChainA, whose bounce receiver processes it (such as by incrementing a counter). This recursive bouncing behavior confirms that the bounce mechanism works as intended, matching the documented behavior described in the bounced messages sections (see  ) and the receiver function documentation (see  ).

Conclusion:

Our comprehensive testing indicates that:
   • Valid bounce receiver implementations (both typed and fallback receivers using Slice) compile and operate exactly as documented.
   • Erroneous definitions (omitting the bounced<T> wrapper, accessing inappropriate fields, or using unsupported text message types) trigger the expected compile-time errors.
   • Multi-contract recursive bouncing behaves as expected, with messages bouncing back when not handled.

In summary, no discrepancies between the Tact documentation (see   and  ) and the compiler's behavior were found. The Tact compiler fully enforces all documented constraints regarding bounced messages and bounce receivers.
