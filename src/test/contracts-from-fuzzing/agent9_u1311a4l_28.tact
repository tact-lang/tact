// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Report on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact
// 
// OVERVIEW:
// This fuzz-testing cycle delved deeply into the bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality of Tact contracts. Our tests were designed to validate both standard and edge-case behavior, cross-checking against the official documentation (e.g. docs_book_bounced.md  , docs_book_contracts.md  , and docs_book_send.md  ). The following areas were rigorously tested:
// 
// 1. Standard Bounce Receiver Usage:
//    - A valid bounce receiver declared with a custom message type (e.g. bounced<MyMessage>) compiled successfully, confirming expected behavior as described in the documentation.
// 
// 2. Invalid Receiver Declarations:
//    - Bounce receivers declared with incorrect parameter types (such as Int or Cell) or missing parameters correctly resulted in compile-time errors. The errors explicitly state that only bounced<T>, message, or Slice are acceptable, which is in perfect accordance with the documented rules.
// 
// 3. Fallback Bounce Receiver:
//    - Bounce receivers defined with a parameter of type Slice (e.g. bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiled without errors, providing a reliable method to catch all bounced messages.
// 
// 4. State Modifications Within Bounce Receivers:
//    - Validation tests confirmed that bounce receivers can modify contract state (e.g. incrementing a counter), thus highlighting a key distinction from getters which are restricted from state changes [(see docs_book_contracts.md   for context)].
// 
// 5. Conflict Prevention:
//    - Efforts to declare multiple bounce receivers for the same message type correctly triggered a conflict error, enforcing the rule of having one unique bounce receiver per message type.
// 
// 6. Advanced Error Handling With Try-Catch:
//    - Integrating try-catch constructs within bounce receivers (after correcting minor syntax requirements) compiled successfully, thereby confirming robust support for error handling in this context.
// 
// 7. Recursive and Cross-Contract Bounce Handling:
//    - Tests involving recursive bounce operations (using self.reply() and self.notify()) as well as inter-contract scenarios compiled as expected, demonstrating the compiler’s ability to manage complex message flows—a behavior further elaborated in docs_book_send.md  .
// 
// 8. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
//    - A test case intended to exceed the 224-bit usable data limit for bounced messages resulted in a precise compile-time error. This verifies that the limitation is strictly enforced in alignment with TON’s specifications, as noted in the documentation.
// 
// CONCLUSION:
// Across all tests, including various valid, edge-case, and error-inducing scenarios, the bounce receiver functionality of the Tact compiler performed exactly as documented. No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were detected. This confirms that the current implementation is robust, follows the official specifications, and is consistent with the information provided in the documentation (see also docs_book_bounced.md   for details on bounced messages).
