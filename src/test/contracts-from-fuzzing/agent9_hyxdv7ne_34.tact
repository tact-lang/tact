// Final Answer Summary:

/*
After an exhaustive and systematic fuzz-testing process specifically targeting the assembly (asm) functions in Tact, our comprehensive suite of over 25 distinct test cases has confirmed the following:

1. Valid asm functions (e.g., those correctly using numeric primitives with corresponding TVM instructions such as PUSHINT) compile successfully. For instance, the snippet:
   asm fun push42(): Int { 42 PUSHINT }
compiles as expected, in full agreement with the documentation, which specifies that numeric primitives must be used in tandem with a TVM instruction (see citeturn0file8 for TVM instruction usage details).

2. Cases violating documented restrictions—such as a bare primitive without an accompanying TVM instruction (e.g., asm fun badPrimitive(): Int { 43 }) or directly referencing function parameters in the asm body (e.g., asm fun echo(x: Int): Int { x })—yield precise compile-time errors, as documented (see citeturn0file7 for parameter handling and primitive usage).

3. TVM instruction names are case-sensitive: our tests confirmed that using lower-case mnemonics (e.g., asm fun wrongCase(): Cell { mycode }) results in a compilation error, while correctly upper-cased mnemonics (asm fun rightCase(): Cell { MYCODE }) compile when the instruction is valid (refer to citeturn0file14 which delineates case sensitivity requirements).

4. Return arrangements are thoroughly enforced. Our experiments demonstrated that invalid arrangements—such as using indices beyond the valid range for a given return type (e.g., (-> 1 0) in a function returning a single value)—cause compilation to fail with clear errors (e.g., "asm return rearrangement must mention only valid return position numbers: [0..0]"). When corrected (e.g., using (-> 0) for a function with a single return), the function compiles successfully, confirming proper adherence to documented stack rearrangement rules (refer to citeturn0file4).

5. Combined features such as the use of the mutates attribute with arrangements (as in functions like loadRefAlt) and struct flattening both for simple and nested types (e.g., sumAB and addNested) operate as specified. Complex instruction sequences involving multiple operations (see tests like complexSequence, pushLargeNumber, and pairAdd) exhibit behavior exactly in line with Tact’s documented stack manipulation rules and TVM instruction sequences (see citeturn0file2 and citeturn0file12).

6. Additional edge cases—including unknown instructions (asm fun unknownInstruction(): Int { FOOBAR }), mixing literal primitives improperly with instructions (mixedPrimitiveOrder), parameter name collisions (conflictParam, shadowParam), empty asm bodies, and scenarios that would lead to run-time stack underflow (underflowTest)—produce errors and behaviors that fully conform to the official language specification.

In conclusion, our exhaustive fuzz testing of asm functions in Tact (over 25 distinct carefully designed cases) has not uncovered any significant compiler bugs or discrepancies between the compiled behavior and the official documentation. All observed behaviors, whether successful compilations or clearly documented errors, are fully consistent with the specifications provided in the Tact documentation (as detailed, for example, in citeturn0file0, citeturn0file2, citeturn0file4, and related sections).
