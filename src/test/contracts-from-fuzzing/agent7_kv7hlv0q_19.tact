// Final Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Summary
//
// In this fuzz-testing cycle, we carefully selected an arbitrary section of the Tact documentation and executed a series of tests to validate key language features and documented claims. Our approach included:
//
// 1. Documentation Section Retrieval:
//    - We reviewed sections on contract syntax, getter functions, control flow statements, and loop constructs as documented in files such as docs_book_contracts.md and docs_book_statements.md.
//
// 2. Variable Declarations:
//    - An initial test using the 'var' keyword resulted in a compilation error, thereby enforcing Tactâ€™s requirement to use 'let' for variable declarations. (See docs_book_statements.md)
//
// 3. Getter Functions and State Modifications:
//    - According to the documentation, getter functions should only read state. However, our test contract (ModifyGetter) intentionally modified a state variable within a getter. The code compiled successfully, confirming the known discrepancy: getter functions are allowed to modify contract state at runtime (with these modifications not persisting after the TVM execution). (See docs_book_contracts.md for the documentation claim.)
//
// 4. Control Flow Constructs:
//    - A simple if/else function verified that conditional statements compile and operate as expected, matching the documentation examples.
//
// 5. Loop Constructs:
//    - A while loop (as in contract WhileTest) accurately incremented a state variable until a condition was met, affirming the proper behavior of while loops as described.
//    - A repeat loop test using a negative iteration count (repeat(-1)) confirmed that the loop body is skipped when given a non-positive count, as documented in the Tact language specification.
//
// Conclusion:
//
// All tested features in this cycle behave as documented, with the sole exception of getter functions. Although the documentation states that getters cannot modify state, our tests reveal that such modifications occur at runtime (albeit non-persistently), which is a known discrepancy.
//
// No new or severe bugs were encountered during this cycle, and all findings are consistent with previously observed behavior.
//
// Future cycles will continue by exploring additional language features including assembly functions, map operations, and further control flow nuances to ensure full validation of the Tact compiler against its documentation.
//
// Entry Point:

fun main(): Int {
    return 0;
}
