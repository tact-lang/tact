// Final Summary: Fuzz Testing Cycle on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality
// =============================================================

/*
Overview:
~~~~~~~~~
In this comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle, we explored the handling of bounced messages and bounce receiver functionalities in Tact contracts.
We systematically tested various documented behaviors and edge cases, such as:

  1. Standard Typed Bounced Receiver Usage:
     - A contract (BounceTestEmpty) sends a bounceable message (EmptyMsg) and uses a bounced receiver (bounced<EmptyMsg>) to capture and process the bounce.

  2. Fallback Bounced Receiver:
     - A contract (BounceFallback) demonstrates that a fallback bounced receiver (using a raw Slice parameter) can capture any bounced message.

  3. Strict Enforcement of Type Constraints:
     - Trials of defining bounced receivers with non-struct types (e.g. bounced<String>) correctly resulted in compile-time errors, confirming that only structured message types (e.g. bounced<MyMsg>) are accepted.

  4. Multi-Level and Chained Bounce Scenarios:
     - Using BounceSender in concert with an unresponsive target (BounceReceiverMissing) and a chained bounce setup (ChainBounce with ChainNonResponder), we simulated multi-step bounce processing where each bounced event may trigger further bounceable messages until a terminal state is reached.

  5. Enforcement of Bounced Message Size Limits:
     - Early tests validated that any message type exceeding the 224 usable data bits limit elicits a compile error, ensuring compliance with documented size constraints.

Results:
~~~~~~~~
All the tested code snippets compiled (or produced the expected compile-time errors) and behaved in full accordance with the official Tact documentation:

  • Typed bounced receivers operate as expected.
  • Fallback receivers capture bounced messages generically.
  • Use of non-structured types for bounced receivers is disallowed.
  • Multi-level bounce triggering and chaining produce sequential bounce responses.
  • The 224-bit limitation on bounced messages is properly enforced.

Conclusion:
~~~~~~~~~~~
The Tact compiler’s behavior for bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality aligns perfectly with the official documentation. 
No discrepancies, bugs, or unexpected behaviors were found during our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle.

The fuzz-testing agent will now proceed with further tests on other Tact language features to ensure continued robustness.

End of Cycle.
