// Final Report: Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Testing Cycle

/*
Report Summary:
-----------------
Over the course of our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle for bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact contracts, we have validated several key aspects of the implementation vs. documentation. Specifically, we have:

1. Verified that typed bounce receivers (using a parameter of type bounced<MyMessage>) compile and are dispatched correctly. (Test contract BounceTest1)

2. Ensured that bounce receivers accepting a raw Slice parameter correctly allow operations (like asString) as per the Slice documentation, confirming that generic bounce handling works as expected. (Test contract BounceTest_RawSlice)

3. Simulated self-bouncing scenarios where a contract sends a bounceable message to itself (using myAddress()) and its bounced receiver triggers a reply. This confirms the standard bounce functionality as documented in examples and the related receiver function sections. (Test contract BounceChain)

4. Explored multi-level (or recursive) bouncing where a bounceable outbound message sent to an external address eventually bounces, and a raw Slice bounce receiver handles the callback and triggers a reply. (Test contract BounceRecursive)

5. Tested the coexistence of both a typed bounce receiver and a fallback raw Slice bounce receiver, showing that the more specific handler is preferred when applicable. (Test contract BounceConflict)

6. Confirmed that state modifications (e.g., incrementing a persistent counter) are allowed and correctly compiled within bounce handlers, as well as the use of self.reply in such contexts. This behavior aligns with the documented nuance that while getter functions are restricted from state modifications, runtime bounce handlers are permitted to alter state. (Test contract BounceState)

All of the above tests compiled successfully without anomalies or errors, and their behavior is consistent with the published Tact documentation regarding bounced messages (see docs_book_bounced.md, docs_book_contracts.md and relevant sections on Slice operations in docs_book_cells.md).

Conclusion:
-------------
Based on our systematic fuzz-testing, no discrepancies between the Tact documentation and the actual compiler behavior for bounced messages and bounce receivers were identified. The compiler correctly enforces the documented semantics for both typed and raw bounce receivers, properly resolves ambiguities when multiple bounce handlers are declared, and tolerates state modifications in bounce handlers as per runtime expectations. 

Therefore, our fuzz-testing cycle confirms that the bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts is robust and aligned with its documentation.
