// Final Output: Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact

/*
Overview:
-----------
This fuzz-testing cycle focused on a deep exploration of bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts. Our approach entailed validating common use cases from the official documentation as well as systematically exploring a wide array of edge cases and error conditions. Specifically, we verified the documented behavior for:

1. Standard Bounce Receiver Usage:
   - Bounce receivers declared with a custom message type (e.g., bounced<MyMessage>) compiled successfully (see docs_book_bounced.md).

2. Invalid Receiver Declarations:
   - Bounce receivers declared with inappropriate parameter types (e.g., Int or Cell) produced compile-time errors with clear messages stating that only bounced<T>, message, or Slice types are allowed.
   - Declaring a bounce receiver without any parameter also resulted in an error.

3. Fallback Handling:
   - Bounce receivers using the fallback approach (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiled as expected, in line with recommended usage for capturing all bounced messages.

4. State Modifications:
   - Bounce receivers that modify contract state (e.g., updating a counter) worked correctly even though getter functions are restricted from causing state changes (refer to docs_book_contracts.md).

5. Receiver Conflicts:
   - Defining multiple bounce receivers for the same message type correctly triggers a conflict error, enforcing the rule that only one such receiver is allowed.

6. Advanced Control Flow with Try-Catch:
   - Incorporating try-catch blocks within a bounce receiver, once properly adjusted for syntax (including a catch parameter), compiled successfully and allowed proper error recovery.

7. Recursive and Cross-Contract Bounce Handling:
   - Complex interactions, such as recursive bounce handling using self.reply() and self.notify(), and cross-contract bounce flows behaved consistently as documented (see docs_book_send.md for supporting outbound messaging details).

8. Enforcement of Message Size Limitations:
   - Attempts to generate or modify a bounced message such that its payload exceeded the 224 usable data bits resulted in an appropriate compile-time error, confirming strict enforcement of network limitations.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our exhaustive tests, which ranged from validating standard use cases to testing nuanced edge scenarios, have confirmed that the compiler behavior for bounced messages and bounce receivers is fully compliant with the Tact documentation. No discrepancies or unintended behaviors were found during this cycle.

- Contract receiver specifications (docs_book_contracts.md)
- Outbound messaging and send behavior (docs_book_send.md)

This cycle confirms that the bounce receiver implementation in the Tact compiler is robust and adheres to the specified requirements. Further fuzz-testing cycles will target additional language features.
