// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle for Tact Compiler Features
// (The following code is for internal testing various aspects of the documentation)

// 1. Constants (Referencing docs on constants and contract constants; see docs_book_integers.md and docs_book_contracts.md for details)

const GlobalConst1: Int = 100 + 200;  // Global constant computed at compile time

contract TestConst {
    const ContractConst1: Int = 300;  // Contract constant (compile-time computed)
    
    // Getter that returns the sum of the two constants
    get fun sum(): Int {
         return GlobalConst1 + self.ContractConst1;
    }
}

// 2. Destructuring Assignment & Renaming (See docs_book_statements.md for destructuring details)

struct Example { number: Int }

fun get42(): Example {
    return Example { number: 42 };
}

// Valid destructuring with renaming (wildcard '_' is disallowed if accessed)
fun renameTest() {
    let Example { number: newNumber } = get42();
    // newNumber should now be 42
    newNumber;
}

// 3. Getter Functions and State Mutation (docs_book_contracts.md mentions getters shouldn't modify state even though runtime modifications are allowed)

contract TestGetter {
    foo: Int;

    init() {
        self.foo = 123;
    }

    // Getter that modifies the state variable. Documentation claims getters cannot modify state but actually such changes are not persisted at runtime.
    get fun modify(): Int {
        self.foo = 456; // This assignment is allowed by the compiler
        return self.foo;
    }
}

// 4. Testing rejection of mixing contract parameters and fields (as described in docs_book_contracts.md).
// The documentation clearly disallows using contract parameters along with contract state variables.
// The following contract must not compile when fields are added along with parameters. (This code is intentionally commented out to allow the rest to compile.)

/*
contract Conflict(p: Int) {
    field: Int; // Compiler error: Cannot define contract fields along with contract parameters

    // init() not allowed along with parameters
    init() {}
}
*/

// 5. Assembly Functions and TVM Instructions (Referencing docs_book_assembly-functions.md):

// Correct usage: TVM instruction without quotes. Should invoke TVM instruction MYCODE during compute phase.
asm fun asmMyCode(): Cell { MYCODE }

// Incorrect usage: Using quotes around a TVM instruction, which makes it a string literal instead of an instruction. Although it compiles, its behavior is different.
asm fun asmWrongMyCode(): Cell { "MYCODE" }

// End of Fuzz Testing Cycle
//
// Summary:
// 1. Contract and global constants behave as documented with compile-time evaluation.
// 2. Destructuring assignment supports field renaming; wildcard '_' is disallowed when accessed, matching documented behavior.
// 3. Getter functions allow state modification in code (though changes are not persisted operationally), which clarifies the note in documentation regarding immutability.
// 4. Mixing contract parameters with state fields is disallowed and correctly results in a compilation error, as documented.
// 5. Assembly functions correctly distinguish between unquoted and quoted TVM instructions.

// All tests have so far aligned with the Tact documentation; no unexpected behavior or discrepancies have been identified in this cycle.
