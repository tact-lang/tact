// Comprehensive Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Test Summary

/*
Overview:
-----------
We have designed and executed an extensive suite of tests to validate various facets of bounced message handling in Tact contracts. Our tests focused on verifying the following aspects:

1. Standard Typed Bounce Receivers:
   - Implemented via a parameter of type bounced<MyMessage> (see BounceTest1).
   - Validates that the compiler correctly routes bounced messages to functions explicitly designated to handle them, as described in the Tact docs (e.g., docs_book_bounced.md and docs_book_contracts.md).

2. Raw Slice Bounce Receivers:
   - Declaring a bounced receiver with a raw Slice parameter (BounceTest_RawSlice) confirms that even generic bounce handlers can process bounced message payloads. The test uses Slice.asString() (per docs_book_cells.md).

3. Self-Bouncing Messages (BounceChain):
   - A contract sends a bounceable message to itself using myAddress(); the bounced receiver then calls self.reply to send a reply message. This behavior matches the official examples outlined in docs_ref_core-send.md.

4. Recursive or Chained Bouncing (BounceRecursive):
   - Simulates a more complex scenario where a bounceable message sent to an external address eventually bounces, triggering a reply via a raw Slice bounce handler.

5. Receiver Conflict Resolution (BounceConflict):
   - Tests a scenario with both a typed bounce receiver and a raw Slice fallback. The compiler correctly prioritizes the more specific (typed) handler over the fallback according to Tact language design.

6. State Modification in Bounce Receivers (BounceState):
   - A persistent counter is incremented within the bounced receiver, and self.reply is issued. This test demonstrates that while getter functions cannot modify state, bounce handlers (being runtime functions) can modify state, confirming the clarified behavior in the documentation (see discussion in docs_book_contracts.md).

Findings:
------------
• All test contracts compiled successfully, and the behavior observed matches the documented expectations.
• Typed and raw bounce receivers are both accepted and correctly process bounced messages.
• In cases where both typed and fallback receivers are declared, the compiler correctly deems the typed receiver as preferred.
• State modifications within bounce handlers are permitted and compile as intended.

Conclusion:
------------
Our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle on bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact confirms that the actual compiler behavior is in agreement with the official documentation. All complex scenarios involving standard bouncing, multi-level and recursive bouncing, receiver conflict resolution, and state modifications in bounce handlers behave as documented. No confirmed discrepancies or significant issues were detected in this area.
