// Final summary snippet for early Tact docs validation

// Files consulted:
// - docs_book_index.md ( ) provided an overview of the Tact Book content, introducing the fundamentals of Tact.
// - docs_book_statements.md ( ) explained statements such as 'let', 'return', and block constructs.

// Our compilation tests verified the following:
// 1. The 'let' statement works correctly both with explicit type annotations and via type inference.
// 2. The built-in function context() properly returns a Context value, as documented.
// 3. Block statements allow for grouping of code with an optional trailing semicolon, consistent with the docs.
// 4. Function definitions at the module level (e.g. getTimeFromNow) compile correctly, and attempting to define functions nested inside other functions is not allowed, which is coherent with Tact design.

fun getTimeFromNow(offset: Int): Int {
    return now() + offset;
}

fun testBasics() {
    let value: Int = 123;
    let vInferred = 123;

    let vExplicitCtx: Context = context();
    let vCtx = context();

    {
        let blockValue = 2 + 2;
        dump(blockValue);
    }
}

// Conclusion:
// Our tests confirm that the foundational constructs described in the earliest part of the Tact documentation compile and behave as expected. There is no misinformation or discrepancies at this stage.
