// Summary of Fuzz Testing for Expressions in Tact
//
// We have been systematically testing various expressions in Tact based on the "Expressions" documentation section. Below is a list of the tested cases and their expected behaviors, with citations as needed:

// 1. Modulo Operator with Negative Divisor:
//    - Test: 1 % -5
//    - Expected: -4, as stated in the documentation for Operators (see /book/operators).
//
// 2. Ternary Operator (conditional expressions):
//    - Test: false ? 1 : (false ? 2 : 3)
//    - Expected: 3, as per the operator precedence and right-associativity described in the Operators section (/book/operators).
//
// 3. Extension Function: asComment() on a string literal:
//    - Test: "hello".asComment()
//    - Expected: A cell representation of the string with 32 zero bits prefixed, as documented in the Expressions section (/book/expressions).
//
// 4. Currency Conversion using ton():
//    - Test: ton("1")
//    - Expected: 1000000000 (1e9), matching the documented conversion rate.
//
// 5. Division Operator Rounding Behavior:
//    - Test: 3 / 2 (should evaluate to 1) and -3 / 2 (should evaluate to -2), which confirms the rounding toward -âˆž as described in /book/primitive-types.
//
// 6. Struct Instantiation and Field Access:
//    - Test: Creating a struct Point { x, y } and summing p.x + p.y, expecting 30 for inputs 10 and 20.
//    - This matches the behavior documented in the "Structs and message structs" section (/book/structs-and-messages).
//
// 7. Operator Precedence:
//    - Test: 5 + 3 * 2 should equal 11, and (5 + 3) * 2 should equal 16, confirming expected arithmetic precedence as described in /book/operators.
//
// 8. Non-Null Assertion Operator (!!):
//    - Test: Using !! on an optional value containing 7 should yield 7, in line with the description in the "Optionals" subsection (/book/optionals).
//
// 9. Integer Literals in Various Bases:
//    - Test: Decimal (42), Hex (0xABC = 2748), Octal (0o777 = 511), and Binary (0b101010 = 42).
//    - These tests conform to the notation described in the "Expressions" section (/book/expressions).
//
// 10. ascii() Function:
//     - Test: ascii("ðŸ‘»") to produce a compile-time computed integer representing the Unicode code points. While the exact numeric value may depend on UTF-8 encoding, it should be computed consistently.
//
// 11. Logical Operators and Short-Circuiting:
//     - Test: Confirm that the logical operators && and || short-circuit their evaluation. Using controlled state mutation (in TestLogicalShortCircuitV3), we verified that in expressions like false && dangerous() and true || dangerous(), the dangerous() call is not executed.
//
// All compiled tests have passed as expected according to the official Tact documentation. No discrepancies or compiler bugs have been observed in the behavior of expression evaluation at this stage.

// With these thorough tests of expression evaluation complete, our fuzz testing so far confirms that the expressions in Tact are parsed, type-checked, and evaluated correctly, matching the expected documentation behavior.

contract FuzzTestingSummary {
    // This contract serves as documentation for our fuzz testing progress on expressions.
    // All the above tests (modulo, ternary, extension functions, ton conversion, division, struct instantiation,
    // operator precedence, non-null assertion, digit literals, ascii conversion, and logical short-circuit) have
    // compiled and run with expected behavior.

    // No issues found in the expression evaluation phase.

    receive() {
        // Optionally, we could implement a simple method to indicate testing completion.
    }
