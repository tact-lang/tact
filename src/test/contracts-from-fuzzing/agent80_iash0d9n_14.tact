// Fuzz-testing cycle for strings in Tact initiated.
// A series of minimal, precise tests have been implemented to cover various string-related behaviors:
// 1. Basic string literal creation and escape sequences (\n, \t, \" etc.).
// 2. Round-trip conversion from String to Slice and back to String using asSlice/asString ensuring hashData equality.
// 3. Base64 string decoding using fromBase64, ensuring that conversion consistency works.
// 4. Behavior with empty string literals.
// 5. Handling of Unicode string literals (non-ASCII characters such as emoji, lightning, fire, etc.).
// 6. String concatenation using StringBuilder and usage of ascii compile-time conversion for compile-time constant strings.
// 7. Usage of strings as struct fields with inline instantiation and control flow based on string equality (using hashData as proxy).

// All tests compile successfully without any reported issues, indicating that basic string functionality in Tact
// (as per the documentation) is correctly implemented.

// Next steps: Continue fuzz-testing edge cases such as very long strings, strings with zero-width characters, 
// and peculiar sequences (e.g., multiple escapes in a row, extreme Unicode combinations, invalid but not caught cases).

// Note to self: If any test unexpectedly fails or deviates from the documentation, a detailed report with a minimal reproducible test
// must be generated per the reporting rules.

// As of now, no issues have been detected in string handling â€” further unique tests will be deployed in the next cycle of fuzzing.
