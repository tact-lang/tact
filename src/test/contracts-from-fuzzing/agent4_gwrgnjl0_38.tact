/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
This cycle rigorously evaluated Tact maps by examining their documented behavior against actual compiler output. We systematically tested aspects such as:

1. Allowed Key Types:
   • Documentation strictly permits only Int and Address as map keys. Our tests confirmed that maps declared with these key types (e.g. map<Int, Int> and map<Address, Int>) compile successfully, while attempting to use other types (e.g. String or Struct) leads to compile-time errors.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   • Maps can store Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types (structs, messages) as values. Our tests validated that these value types can be used, and that serialization (e.g. Int as uint8) works when specified for integer types, in full compliance with documentation.

3. Core Map Operations:
   • We verified that insertion (.set), querying (.get, .exists), updating (.replace, .replaceGet), and deletion (.del or using null in .set) work exactly as the docs describe. Compiler outputs confirmed that expected boolean or previous values are returned upon replacement and deletion.

4. Nested Maps & Iteration:
   • Our tests with nested maps (where an inner map is wrapped inside a struct and stored in an outer map) confirmed that iteration via foreach is allowed only on valid path expressions (e.g., self.data) and is rejected otherwise. This behavior aligns with documentation restrictions on map iteration.

5. Equality Comparisons:
   • We differentiated between shallow equality (using the '==' operator, which compares underlying cell hashes) and deep equality (using .deepEquals() for an entry-by-entry comparison). Our experiments showed that the two operators behave as documented, with deepEquals providing a gas-expensive, full comparison when necessary.

6. Edge Cases – Boolean Values:
   • Maps holding Bool values compile and execute as expected, once minor syntactic adjustments were made. This confirms that Bool is a permitted value type.

Documentation Citations:
-------------------------
Key details were confirmed by sections from docs_book_maps.md (e.g. allowed types, operations, serialization details) and docs_book_statements.md (for iteration constraints), as well as docs_book_operators.md (for equality comparisons).

Conclusion:
-----------
Every aspect of Tact maps was fuzz-tested using multiple minimal code snippets. All observed behaviors—ranging from key type restrictions and operation semantics to nested maps and equality comparisons—matched the official documentation perfectly. No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were found in our extensive tests. 

Final Verdict: The Tact maps feature is robust and behaves exactly as documented.
