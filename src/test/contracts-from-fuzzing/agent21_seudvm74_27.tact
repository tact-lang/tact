// Next Phase: Multi-Message Processing, Fallback Receivers, and State Boundary Testing

/*
Overview:
-----------
While our previous extensive fuzz-testing cycle has rigorously validated bounced message handling, try-catch error propagation (including nested structures), and recursive bounce message operations, we now proceed with a further phase of fuzz testing focusing on additional complex features of the Tact compiler:

1. Multi-Message Processing and Combined Modes:
   - We will test the interplay of different outbound message sending modes (e.g., SendRemainingValue versus SendRemainingBalance) in scenarios where multiple messages are queued in a single receiver. 
   - We want to ensure that the remaining balances are computed correctly, considering conflicting calls to message-sending functions as described in the documentation.

2. Fallback Receivers and Raw Slice Handling:
   - Beyond typed bounced message receivers, we will further examine fallback receivers which catch all unhandled or raw messages (using a parameter of type Slice). 
   - We anticipate that these fallback handlers capture any message that does not match any of the specific receiver signatures, ensuring complete coverage.

3. Boundary Value Testing in State Variables:
   - We plan to create scenarios where state variables (such as those declared as Int as uint8 or Int as uint4) are modified near their serialization limits. 
   - Such tests will confirm that the compiler accurately flags any final persistent state updates that exceed their declared ranges, as documented.

4. Contracts with Overlapping Parameters and Initialization:
   - Finally, we will test contracts that attempt to combine explicit contract parameters with contract field declarations and delayed initialization (implicit init). 
   - The official documentation forbids such a combination, so we expect to see compile-time errors when this is attempted.

Plan for Fuzz Tests:
----------------------
A. Multi-Message Sender Test:
   - Construct a contract that calls multiple message-sending functions in a single receiver. 
   - Verify that the action phase processes messages in the documented order (all messages are queued) and that conflicting modes (e.g., using both SendRemainingValue and SendRemainingBalance) raise the appropriate exit codes.

B. Fallback Message Receiver Test:
   - Build a contract with a fallback receiver function defined as: 
       bounced(rawMsg: Slice) { ... } 
   - Send messages with unrecognized types (or intentionally malformed opcode headers) and ensure that the fallback receiver captures them.

C. State Boundary Test:
   - Create a contract that defines persistent state variables with narrow types (e.g., Int as uint8 and Int as uint4), then perform calculations that cause the intermediate values to exceed these limits. 
   - Ensure that the final state update in the compute phase triggers exit code 5 for "Integer out of expected range" if the range is violated.

D. Contract Parameter and Field Conflict Test:
   - Write a minimal contract that uses both contract parameters and contract field declarations. 
   - Verify that a compile-time error is produced, as documented.

Documentation References:
---------------------------
Our forthcoming tests are guided by the explanations in:
   - [Bounced messages documentation](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/bounced) (citeturn0file0)
   - [Contract field and parameter initialization](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts) (citeturn0file5, citeturn0file2)
   - [Message sending modes and exit codes](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/message-mode) (citeturn0file6)

Next Steps:
-----------
We will now craft a series of minimal code snippets addressing each point (A–D) above, compiling each with 'compile_snippet' to validate the compiler behavior in these complex scenarios.

No bugs have been confirmed so far, and our current results continue to remain consistent with the Tact documentation. We persist in our exploration by diving deep into these additional areas.
