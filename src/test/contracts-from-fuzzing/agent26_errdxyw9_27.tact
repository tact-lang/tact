Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report: initOf Functionality and Cross-Contract Relationships

In this comprehensive testing cycle, we rigorously evaluated the behavior of the initOf expression along with various cross-contract relationship patterns as documented in Tact.

Our testing focused on several key areas:

1. Simple cross-contract initialization: One contract obtained the StateInit of another, verifying that the initOf expression produces a valid StateInit structure.

2. Multi-level and hierarchical relationships: Parent-Child relationships were tested with parameter passing (including trailing commas) to ensure that argument handling behaves as documented (see docs_book_expressions.md for details on initOf).

3. Complex dependency graphs and inline compositions: We combined multiple initOf calls using structs (such as CombinedDeps and DeepGraph), and verified that computed contract addresses (via contractAddress and newAddress functions) match runtime addresses (via myAddress). This functionality is documented in the addresses section (docs_ref_core-addresses.md).

4. Recursive and circular initializations: Tests such as Recursion, RecursiveGetter, and the circular pattern with CircA/CircB confirmed that a contract can safely invoke initOf on itself or in a circular fashion without triggering internal compiler errors.

5. Type safety and parameter validation: Tests that intentionally passed incorrect parameter types correctly produced compile-time errors, enforcing Tact’s static typing requirements.

6. Inline function use: The InlineInit tests confirmed that inline functions invoking initOf require self-qualification as per language design.

7. Integration with address computation: Several tests combined initOf with contractAddress to compute the contract’s address from its initial state, ensuring consistency with the documented behavior.

Throughout all these scenarios, the compiler adhered strictly to documented claims. All tests intended to compile did so successfully (with misuse cases resulting in expected compile-time errors), and no unexpected behavior was observed.

For more details, please refer to the official documentation excerpts:
 • initOf usage and syntax: see docs_book_expressions.md (e.g., the initOf section)
 • Contract address computation using StateInit: see docs_ref_core-addresses.md

Conclusion: Our exhaustive fuzz-testing cycle confirms that initOf functionality and cross-contract relationship handling in Tact are implemented robustly and in complete alignment with the official documentation. No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs have been identified in this area.
