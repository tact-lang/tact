// Summary of comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle for contract addresses in Tact

/*
    We executed an exhaustive suite of tests targeting the following behaviors: 
    • Creation of addresses using newAddress() with valid workchain IDs (0, -1) and boundary hash values.
    • Ensuring invalid workchain IDs cause compile-time errors.
    • Conversion between Address and Slice using asSlice() and asAddressUnsafe() and verifying roundtrip behavior.
    • Testing equality and inequality for addresses:
         - Same hash in same chain yields equality.
         - Same hash with different chain IDs (0 vs -1) yields inequality.
    • Verifying the output string of toString() is non-empty.
    • Using state storage operations involving addresses, then updating and verifying state.
    • Integrating tests with maps that use Address keys to ensure that addresses differ when chain IDs differ.

    We also combined these tests via a getter function (runAllTests) to run all logic at once. 

    Our sample code snippets executed without issues, and the compiler behavior aligns with the documentation in:
       - docs_ref_core-addresses.md
       - docs_book_contracts.md

    No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were observed during this cycle.

    We will continue further subtle and edge-case testing as part of our ongoing fuzzing process, but so far all tests confirm documented behavior.
