// Final Answer Summary:

/*
Our investigation began by reviewing the earliest sections of the Tact documentation, particularly the introductory parts described in docs_book_index.md and docs_book_statements.md.

Key points validated include:

1. Variable Declarations:
   • The 'let' statement works with both explicit type annotations (e.g., let value: Int = 123) and type inference (e.g., let vInferred = 123).

2. Built-in Functions:
   • The built-in function context() correctly returns a Context structure, aligning with the documentation examples.

3. Block Statements:
   • Blocks delimited by { } work as expected and allow omitting a trailing semicolon on the last statement.

4. Function Declarations:
   • Module-level function declarations (e.g., getTimeFromNow) compile successfully, confirming that Tact requires all code to reside in functions.
   • Attempting to declare variables directly at the module level outside any function leads to a compilation error, as per language design.

Testing these constructs with our Compile Snippet tool confirmed all expected behavior, and no discrepancies or bugs were detected relative to the documented examples.

Conclusion: The fundamental constructs introduced in the earliest parts of the Tact documentation are accurate, and our tests show that the examples compile and behave as expected.

fun getTimeFromNow(offset: Int): Int {
    return now() + offset;
}

fun testBasics() {
    // Testing explicit and inferred let declarations
    let value: Int = 123;
    let vInferred = 123;

    // Testing the context() function as per documentation
    let vExplicitCtx: Context = context();
    let vCtx = context();

    // Testing a block statement with optional trailing semicolon
    {
        let blockValue = 2 + 2;
        dump(blockValue);
    }
}
