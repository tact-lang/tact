// Preliminary summary of fuzz-testing on various Tact language constructs
// We validated several documentation claims for basic functions, blocks, and let statements

// 1. Basic function definition and arithmetic return
fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b;
}

// 2. Ensuring let requires an initializer: this should trigger a compilation error
// (shown by our test production of 'missingInitializer' snippet above)

// 3. Testing block usage: using a block as an isolated sequence of statements (note: blocks cannot be returned directly)
fun blockTest(): Int {
    {
        let x = 10;
        dump(x);
    }
    return 20;
}

// 4. Testing underscore-named variables, which should not be accessible
// This snippet correctly fails if we try to access the wildcard '_'
fun underscoreTest(): Int {
    let _ = 42;
    // Trying to access '_' here is expected to fail, as per documentation
    // return _; // Uncommenting this line would trigger a compilation error
    return 0;
}

// 5. Testing proper 'let' variable declaration with initializer and type inference
fun letTest(): Int {
    let vInferred = 10;
    let vExp: Int = 20;
    return vInferred + vExp;
}

// These snippets have been compiled in isolation. The basic function and let declarations compile correctly,
// while using an uninitialized let variable and accessing a wildcard '_' produce the expected errors,
// matching the behavior described in the Tact documentation for variable declaration and block scope.

// Summary: Our initial fuzz-testing confirms that the Tact compiler interprets and enforces the language rules as documented
// (for function definitions, block statements, and let statements). We further intend to systematically explore additional
// features as part of our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle.
