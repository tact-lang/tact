/*
Test Case Analysis: Getter Functions and State Modifications

From our earlier fuzz tests (see TestGetterModification in our compiled code), we observe that while the official Tact documentation claims that getter functions "cannot modify the contract’s state variables" (as seen in docs_book_contracts.md  ), the actual compiler and runtime behavior allows modifications inside getters during execution. 

Specifically, in our TestGetterModification contract, which is defined as:

    contract TestGetterModification {
        foo: Int;

        init() {
            self.foo = 0;
        }

        get fun getFoo(): Int {
            // Modification is performed here at runtime
            self.foo = self.foo + 1;
            return self.foo;
        }
    }

compilation and execution succeed, and the function will return a modified value. However, these changes are ephemeral—they are not saved to the persistent state after the TVM run completes. 

This confirms that although getters are conceptually restricted to read-only behavior (likely for off-chain purity and to avoid unexpected state changes), the Tact runtime permits state modifications during the execution of getter functions. The changes do not persist, meaning that subsequent calls to the getter will not reflect previous modifications.

In summary, while the documentation (see docs_book_contracts.md  ) states that getters cannot modify state, our fuzz testing explicitly demonstrates that they can modify state variables at runtime—the modifications are simply not committed to storage. Developers should be aware of this nuance and avoid relying on getters for persistent state changes.
