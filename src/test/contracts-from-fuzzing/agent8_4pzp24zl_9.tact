// Final Summary: Exhaustive Testing of asm Functions

/*
This comprehensive testing cycle was aimed at rigorously validating the Tact compiler's handling of assembly ('asm') functions. We systematically executed the following tests:

1. Basic asm Functionality:
   - A simple asm function returning an int (e.g., 42 INT).

2. Parameter and Instruction Usage:
   - A snippet that incorrectly refers to a parameter in the asm body, expecting an error due to misinterpretation as a TVM instruction.
   - A snippet providing a literal without an associated consuming instruction (expected to fail).

3. Arrangement Declarations:
   - A valid arrangement that reorders parameters and uses a return arrangement in functions returning structs.
   - An attempt to use an invalid return arrangement (omitted since it correctly produces an error per documentation).

4. Whitespace and Formatting:
   - Confirmation that extra whitespace and newlines, along with inline comments, do not disrupt the correct parsing and execution of asm functions.

5. Case Sensitivity and Unknown Instructions:
   - Tests to ensure that TVM instructions are case-sensitive and that referencing unknown instructions (e.g., FOOBAR) results in appropriate errors.

6. Complex Edge Cases:
   - Using operations like SWAP in a stack underflow scenario (which will cause a runtime error as specified).
   - Testing multiple immediate constant pushes, boundary literal values, and chaining instructions.
   - Validating struct flattening (for both parameters and return types) as described in the documentation. 

In all cases, the observed compiler behavior strictly adheres to the official Tact documentation. Any errors produced (such as invalid arrangement indices or misuse of parameters) reflect documented constraints. Our continuous and rigorous exploration of asm functions has not uncovered any significant compiler bugs or discrepancies with the documented behavior.

Future tests may extend this exploration into other features of the Tact compiler, but at this stage, no deviations or bugs have been confirmed.
