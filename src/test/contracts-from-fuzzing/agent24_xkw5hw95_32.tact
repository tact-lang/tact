// Final Answer: Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Summary for Bounce Receivers in Tact Contracts

/*
Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Testing Summary
-------------------------------------

Our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle focused on bounced messages and bounce receiver functionalities in Tact contracts has confirmed that the Tact compiler adheres strictly to the official documentation. Here’s a summary of our key findings:

1. Documentation Alignment:
   • According to the Tact documentation (see docs_book_bounced.md citeturn0file0 and docs_book_contracts.md citeturn0file9), a message sent with the bounce flag set to true bounces back if not processed correctly. To handle such messages, a contract must implement a bounce receiver. Valid forms are:
         - A typed bounce receiver: for example, 
               bounced(msg: bounced<T>) { … }
         - A raw bounce receiver that accepts a Slice: 
               bounced(rawMsg: Slice) { … }
   • The documentation mandates that exactly one parameter must be declared for a bounce receiver. Any duplicate definitions or incorrect parameter types must be rejected at compile time.

2. Fuzz-Testing Results:
   • Valid bounce receiver implementations were confirmed:
       - The ValidBounceTyped contract, which uses a typed bounce receiver (bounced(msg: bounced<BounceMsg>)) with a simple message type, compiles successfully.
       - Similarly, the ValidBounceRaw contract (using bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compiled without issue.
   • The compiler correctly rejects invalid bounce receiver definitions (e.g., duplicate receivers, missing or erroneous parameters), enforcing the documented constraints.
   • A multi-contract bounce scenario was successfully set up where the CallerChain contract sends a message with bounce enabled to a ReceiverChain contract that deliberately fails (using require(false, ...)). The CallerChain’s bounce receiver captures the bounced message (verified via a state update), demonstrating correct propagation of bounced messages between contracts.
   • Additionally, using an underscore to indicate an unused bounce receiver parameter (e.g., bounced(_msg: bounced<BounceMsg>)) is handled properly.

3. Conclusion:
   • Our exhaustive tests confirm that the bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact are robust and behave exactly as documented.
   • There were no discrepancies or unexpected behaviors observed; valid bounce receiver constructs compile and function correctly, while erroneous definitions are reliably rejected.

This comprehensive evaluation confirms that the bounce receiver mechanism in Tact operates precisely as specified by the documentation with no confirmed issues.
