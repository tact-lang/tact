// Final Answer Summary for Bounce Receiver Fuzz-Testing in Tact

/*
Overview:

We conducted an extensive fuzz-testing cycle focused on bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts. Our tests targeted both standard documented features and multiple edge-case scenarios as described in the Tact documentation.

Key Areas and Findings:

1. Valid Bounce Receiver Patterns:
   • Bounce receivers defined with the correct syntax (e.g., using the type wrapper: bounced(msg: bounced<PingMsg>)) compiled successfully. This confirms that the compiler enforces the required message wrapper as documented in the bounced messages section (see docs_book_bounced.md  ).
   • Fallback bounce receivers using a raw Slice parameter (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) also compiled correctly, thereby catching any bounced messages. This aligns with the design described in the contract receivers documentation (see docs_book_contracts.md  ).

2. Invalid Bounce Receiver Patterns (Intentional Errors):
   • Defining a bounce receiver without the bounced<T> wrapper (such as using a plain message type) produced a compile-time error, strictly enforcing the documented constraints.
   • Attempts to reference non-existent fields in a bounced message (for example, accessing msg.x when only msg.value is defined) reliably resulted in a compilation error, confirming the strict type-safety requirements.
   • Declarations attempting to set the bounced type to a string (e.g. bounced(msg: bounced<string>)) were rejected as bounced text messages are explicitly not supported, in line with the documentation.

3. Multi-Contract and Recursive Bouncing Scenarios:
   • We simulated a recursive bouncing scenario using two contracts. One (BounceChainA) sends a bounce-enabled message to a second contract (BounceChainB) that lacks a receiver. As expected, BounceChainB did not process the message and it bounced back to BounceChainA, whose bounce receiver then incremented a counter. This behavior confirms that the bouncing mechanism adheres to the documented rules regarding message forwarding and bouncing (refer to docs_book_bounced.md   and docs_book_contracts.md  ).

Conclusion:

The fuzz-testing cycle confirms that the Tact compiler's behavior regarding bounced messages and bounce receivers is fully consistent with the official documentation:
   - Valid bounce receiver implementations compile and function as expected.
   - Erroneous definitions (missing the proper bounced wrapper, referring to non-existent message fields, or using unsupported types) trigger the correct compile-time errors.
   - Recursive bounce handling across multiple contracts behaves as documented.

Our comprehensive tests reveal no discrepancies or issues with the bounced message mechanism, and all observed behaviors are in perfect alignment with the documented specifications.
