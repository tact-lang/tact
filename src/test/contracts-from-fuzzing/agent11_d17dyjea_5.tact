/*
 Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle (Initial Phase)

 In this initial fuzzing cycle, we targeted several key Tact language features based on the official documentation:

 1. Let Statements and Type Inference:
    - As described in the [Statements]( ) section, we validated that local variable declarations require an initializer, allowing for both explicit and implicit type annotations.
    
 2. Wildcard Variables using Underscore:
    - The documentation explicitly mentions that a variable named '_' is considered unused and cannot be later accessed (see [Let Statements]( )).
    - We confirmed that attempting to access '_' results in a compile-time error.

 3. Try...Catch Behavior:
    - The [try...catch]( ) examples outline that errors thrown within a try block should be caught in the corresponding catch block. We validated this behavior by throwing a constant exit code (42) and catching it.

 4. If-Else Statement Functionality:
    - We compiled a snippet using an if-else statement exactly as outlined in the documentation. This confirmed that the control-flow constructs behave as expected.

 5. Function Definition and Return Semantics:
    - Basic arithmetic operations and return statements operate as documented.

 Below is an aggregated Tact snippet that incorporates these elements. Each segment corresponds to testing one of the features mentioned above. Note that we have commented out the segment testing wildcard variable access, which was intended to produce a compile error (as expected).

    // Test for valid local variable declarations and type inference

    return a + b;
}

// The following function intentionally causes a compile error by trying to access the wildcard '_' variable
