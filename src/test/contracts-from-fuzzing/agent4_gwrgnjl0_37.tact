/*
Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Report for Tact Maps (Dictionaries)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
----------
Our fuzz-testing cycle focused on rigorously validating the implementation and documented behavior of maps (dictionaries) in Tact. We systematically explored several aspects:

1. Allowed Key Types:
   • Documentation (see   from docs_book_maps.md) states that only Int and Address can be used as map keys.
   • Tests confirmed that maps declared with key types Int (e.g. map<Int, Int>) and Address (e.g. map<Address, Int>) compile and work correctly, while attempts to use disallowed key types (e.g. String or Struct) are correctly rejected with compile-time errors.

2. Allowed Value Types & Serialization:
   • The official docs (see   from docs_book_maps.md) specify that allowed value types include Int, Bool, Cell, Address, and composite types.
   • Furthermore, only Int keys (and, when applicable, values) support serialization (e.g. using "as uint8"). Tests using serialized maps (e.g. map<Int as uint8, Int as uint8>) have behaved as expected.

3. Core Map Operations:
   • We tested operations such as insertion (.set), querying (.get, .exists), updating (.replace, .replaceGet), and deletion (.del or assigning null). The observed behavior matches exactly with the examples in the documentation (see citeturn0file0–citeturn0file5 from docs_book_maps.md).

4. Nested Maps & Iteration Constraints:
   • Documentation notes that iteration via foreach is only allowed on maps accessed via valid path expressions (see citeturn8file from docs_book_statements.md). Our tests with nested maps (implemented by storing an inner map within a struct, e.g. AllowanceMap) confirmed that iteration works when maps are referenced correctly (e.g. using self.data) and is rejected in invalid contexts.

5. Equality Comparisons:
   • Per documentation, shallow equality (using the '==' operator) compares maps by their underlying cell hashes, while deep equality (.deepEquals()) checks entries pair-by-pair. Our tests confirmed this distinction precisely (see citeturn0file7 from docs_book_maps.md and citeturn0file4 from docs_book_operators.md).

6. Edge Cases (Boolean Map Values):
   • We also verified that maps with Bool as the value type compile and behave correctly when used with conditional expressions after resolving minor syntactic issues.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our extensive fuzz-testing across a variety of scenarios — including valid and invalid key/value type configurations, operations (insertion, deletion, replace, comparison), nested map usage, and iteration constraints — confirms that the Tact compiler’s implementation of maps aligns perfectly with the official documentation. No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were observed.

All tested behaviors were consistent with the documented specifications:
  - Only Int and Address are accepted as key types.
  - Allowed value types, including serialized integers, function as described.
  - Map operations perform exactly as expected.
  - Nested maps and iteration follow the documented rules.
  - Shallow versus deep equality comparisons are properly distinguished.
