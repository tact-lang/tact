// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle for Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality in Tact

/*
This fuzz-testing cycle aimed to rigorously validate the behavior and robustness of bounced messages and bounce receivers in Tact contracts. Our approach was to systematically explore every aspect of the feature by generating minimal test snippets that cover:

1. Standard Bounce Receiver Declaration:
   - Using a dedicated bounce receiver with a custom message type (e.g., bounced<MyMessage>) compiled without error, confirming that the documented usage (see docs_book_bounced.md) is accurate.

2. Invalid Receiver Definitions:
   - Bounce receivers declared with invalid types (for example, a parameter of type Int or Cell) or defined without any input parameter produced clear compile-time errors. This confirms that only types of the form bounced<T>, message types, or Slice are permitted, as documented.

3. Fallback Receiver Functionality:
   - A bounce receiver accepting a raw Slice (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) works as a catch-all mechanism for bounced messages and compiles successfully. This is in line with the fallback handler recommendations in the documentation.

4. State Modification within Bounce Receivers:
   - Tests that modify state (e.g., incrementing a counter) within a bounce receiver compiled and executed correctly, reinforcing the fact that while getter functions are read-only, bounce receivers can safely perform state updates.

5. Multiple Bounce Receiver Conflict Prevention:
   - Attempts to declare two bounce receivers for the same message type correctly resulted in a conflict error. This unique mapping rule prevents ambiguity and matches the language's design constraints.

6. Advanced Control Flow Constructs:
   - Incorporation of try-catch blocks within bounce receivers (after correct syntax adjustments) compiled successfully, demonstrating that error handling constructs are supported. Additionally, recursive bounce handling via self.reply() and self.notify() in cross-contract scenarios compiled as expected.

7. Enforcement of Message Size Limits:
   - We also tested operations where a bounced message would exceed the 224 usable data bits limit. The compiler raised the proper error in such cases, confirming strict enforcement of this limitation (as documented in docs_book_bounced.md).

References from Documentation:
   - Bounced messages and their limitations are discussed in the bounced messages documentation (see docs_book_bounced.md).
   - Contract receiver functions, including bounce receivers, are detailed in docs_book_contracts.md.
   - Messaging and outbound message handling (self.reply, self.notify) are described in docs_book_send.md.

Conclusion:
-----------
Our comprehensive suite of tests, which frequently compiled and evaluated various edge cases, has demonstrated that the bounce receiver functionality in Tact behaves exactly as specified by the documentation. Every aspect—from standard use to error edge cases (invalid types, missing parameters, multiple declarations, advanced try-catch and recursive behavior) and message size restrictions—operates in strict accordance with the official specification.

No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors have been found. The Tact compiler robustly enforces bounce receiver constraints, ensuring that developers can rely on the documented semantics when handling bounced messages.

This fuzz-testing cycle is complete for the bounced messages feature; further cycles will continue to explore other areas of the Tact language.
