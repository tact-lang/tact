// Fuzz-testing report for bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts
// 
// This suite of tests covered various aspects of bounced messages and the bounce receiver feature in Tact, referencing the official documentation (e.g., docs_book_bounced.md  , docs_book_contracts.md  ) and validating the compiler behavior. The tests included the following scenarios:
// 
// 1. Standard bounce receiver declaration using bounced<M> with a custom message type (MyMessage). This compiled successfully, confirming that the basic usage is consistent with documentation.
// 
// 2. Bounce receiver with an invalid type (e.g., Int) was rejected at compile time with an error message stating "Bounce receive function can only accept bounced message, message or Slice." This matches the documented constraints.
// 
// 3. Bounce receiver declared with no parameters resulted in a compile-time error as expected.
// 
// 4. A fallback bounce receiver using a Slice parameter compiled without errors, verifying that this approach is supported for handling all bounced messages.
// 
// 5. State modifications within bounce receivers (e.g., incrementing a counter) behave as expected, confirming that while getters have state modification restrictions, bounced receivers do permit state changes.
// 
// 6. Declaring two bounce receivers for the same message type correctly results in a conflict error, preventing multiple receivers for the same message type in a contract.
// 
// 7. Incorporating try-catch logic within a bounce receiver worked with proper syntax, confirming that error handling mechanisms are supported within bounced message contexts.
// 
// 8. A cross-contract scenario was explored, with a sender sending a message that bounces due to a receiver lacking a matching message handler. This test confirmed that bounced message propagation and handling via self.reply and self.notify follow the documented behavior (see docs_book_send.md  , docs_book_bounced.md  ).
// 
// 9. An attempt to modify a bounced messageâ€™s data field in a way that exceeds the 224-bit limit generated an error, which is consistent with limitations discussed in the documentation. This indicates that the compiler properly enforces message size restrictions.
// 
// 10. Additional tests exploring recursive bounce handling (invoking self.reply within a bounce receiver) and using self.notify confirmed that complex interactions can be implemented as described in the docs.
// 
// In summary, all tested scenarios, including edge cases, complied with the documented behavior. No discrepancies or compiler bugs were observed in terms of bounced message handling or bounce receiver constraints.
// 
// End of fuzz-testing report for bounced messages.
