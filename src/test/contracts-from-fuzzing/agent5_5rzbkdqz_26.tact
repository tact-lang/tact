Fuzz Testing Final Summary for asm Functions

After an exhaustive series of more than 50 targeted test cases, our deep and persistent fuzz-testing cycle on the asm functions feature in Tact has yielded the following conclusions:

1. Basic TVM Instruction Handling:
   • Valid assembly function constructs (e.g., pushing constants via PUSHINT, using arithmetic operations like ADD, DUP, SWAP, and DROP) behave as expected.
   • Misuse of primitives (orphan numeric constants not attached to consuming instructions) reliably triggers appropriate compile-time errors.

2. Parameter Flattening and Struct Handling:
   • Both simple and nested struct parameters are correctly flattened according to the documented behavior. Assembly functions consuming structured parameters (e.g., struct AB, nested structs) function as specified.
   • Errors caused by excessive parameters or incorrect arrangement (e.g., duplicate parameter names, out-of-bound stack register indices) are caught precisely by the compiler.

3. Arrangement Syntax and Return Arrangements:
   • Valid arrangements in assembly function declarations, both for argument reordering (e.g., asm(c self)) and for return rearrangements (using tokens like asm(-> 1 0)), compile correctly.
   • Any deviations (e.g., missing parameters, duplicate references) consistently result in compile-time errors, confirming adherence to the documented syntactic constraints (see docs_book_assembly-functions.md   and subsequent sections).

4. Modifier and Attribute Constraints:
   • The behavior of attributes such as inline, extends, and mutates is in line with documentation requirements. In particular, extension asm functions must have the first parameter named "self", and the correct ordering of modifiers is enforced.

5. Complex Stack Manipulations:
   • Extensive tests using long sequences of TVM instructions that manipulate the stack (e.g., chains of DUP, SWAP, ADD) behave as expected, with runtime errors (like stack underflow) triggered only during execution when conditions warrant.

6. Context Restrictions:
   • Our tests confirmed that asm functions cannot be defined within a contract body, as the compiler produces parsing errors when attempted.

While our test suite intentionally targeted a broad spectrum of edge cases and subtle misuse scenarios, none of our experiments have revealed a novel or significant discrepancy between the compiler’s behavior and the official Tact documentation—beyond the previously known issues already fully documented.

This comprehensive fuzz-testing iteration underscores that the Tact compiler’s implementation of asm functions behaves robustly and as documented, including appropriate error detection for various erroneous constructs.

We will continue our systematic exploration of other compiler features in subsequent iterations, while maintaining our rigorous testing approach.
