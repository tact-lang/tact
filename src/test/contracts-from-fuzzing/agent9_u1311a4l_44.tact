// Final consolidated output from the fuzz-testing cycle:
// 
// Our comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle on bounced messages and bounce receiver functionality in Tact contracts has produced the following results:
// 
// 1. Standard Usage: Bounce receivers declared with a custom message type – for example, 
//    'bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }' – compile successfully. This confirms that basic usage adheres perfectly to the documented behavior (see docs_book_bounced.md  ).
// 
// 2. Invalid Receiver Declarations: Attempts to define bounce receivers with incorrect parameter types (like Int or Cell) or with no parameter result in clear compile-time errors. The compiler explicitly enforces that only parameters of type bounced<T>, message, or Slice are permitted, which aligns with the behavior described in the documentation (see docs_book_contracts.md  ).
// 
// 3. Fallback Catch-All: Bounce receivers that capture any bounced message using a Slice parameter (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compile without issue, verifying the fallback approach recommended in the documentation (see docs_book_bounced.md  ).
// 
// 4. State Modifications: Tests demonstrate that bounce receivers can safely modify contract state (e.g., incrementing a counter), a capability that distinguishes them from getter functions which cannot change state.
// 
// 5. Unique Receiver Enforcement: Attempts to declare multiple bounce receivers for the same message type result in conflict errors, ensuring that only one bounce handler is active per message type as required.
// 
// 6. Advanced Control Flow: Incorporation of try-catch blocks (with proper syntax) within bounce receivers compiles successfully. Likewise, recursive and cross-contract bounce handling using functions like self.reply() and self.notify() perform as documented (see docs_book_send.md  ).
// 
// 7. Message Size Limitations: Efforts to operate on bounced messages in a way that exceeds the 224 usable data bits limit correctly yield compile-time errors, confirming that this strict limitation is enforced.
// 
// Conclusion:
// 
// Comprehensive testing shows that every scenario—from valid usage and state modifications to invalid definitions and advanced control flow—behaves exactly as described in the official Tact documentation. No discrepancies, unexpected behaviors, or compiler bugs were found during this fuzz-testing cycle. The bounce message handling and bounce receiver features are robust and function exactly as specified.
// 
// This cycle of fuzz-testing confirms the accuracy and reliability of the Tact compiler in handling bounced messages. Testing will now continue into additional Tact features.
