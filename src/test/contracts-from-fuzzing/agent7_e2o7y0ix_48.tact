      Continuing Our Systematic Fuzz Testing Cycle
      ------------------------------------------------------------
      In our previous cycles, we rigorously exercised Tact’s features for maps and dictionaries (including advanced operations, serialization, nested maps, etc.), bitwise operators, structs and messages, error handling via try-catch, contract state modifications (and ephemeral changes in getters), and optionals and null handling.

      All these features performed exactly as described in the official documentation. The only nuance observed was a mandatory syntactic requirement: in nested map type declarations, a space must be inserted between consecutive closing angle brackets (e.g. writing "map<Int, map<Int, Int> >") to resolve parsing ambiguity. This is a known parser behavior and does not represent a functional compiler bug.

      With no significant compiler bugs or documentation mismatches found in our exhaustive fuzz testing cycle, we now continue our systematic exploration into other advanced Tact compiler features with the same depth and rigor.

      Next, we plan to explore areas such as advanced control flow constructs (loops, recursion, and contract function calls), further nuances in state management under concurrent message processing, and integration with assembly functions—areas that may reveal additional subtle edge cases.

      Final status: All tested features (maps, bitwise operators, structs & messages, error handling, state modifications, optionals, and message receivers) conform to the official documentation. No significant issues detected.
