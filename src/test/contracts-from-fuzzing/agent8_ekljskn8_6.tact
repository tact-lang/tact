// Fuzz-testing cycle summary for Tact documentation validation
//
// In our initial fuzz-testing cycle, we examined several features documented in Tact:
//
// 1. Function declarations: Basic function add compiles as expected.
//
// 2. Use of wildcard variables: Attempting to access a variable named '_' correctly results in a compilation error, as documented.
//
// 3. Try...catch constructs: The provided try...catch example (niceCatch) compiles and behaves consistently with documentation.
//
// 4. Contract fields vs. contract parameters: Declaring a contract with both parameters and fields fails, as expected.
//
// 5. Let variable declarations: A declaration without an initializer fails to compile, in line with the language specification.
//
// Future targets for fuzz-testing include testing nested parentheses limitations and additional error-handling constructs (e.g., nested try...catch scenarios and throwIf/throwUnless functions).
//
// Since all tests performed so far reflect documented behavior with no discrepancies, our fuzz-testing cycle continues without any severe issues.

fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b;
}

fun testUnderscoreAccess() {
    // This test demonstrates that accessing wildcard variable '_' fails
    let _ = 42;
    //dump(_); // Compilation error as expected
}

fun niceCatch() {
    try {
        throw(1042);
    } catch (err) {
        dump(err);
    }
}

contract ParamParamParam(
    param1: Int,
    param2: Int,
) {
    // This should cause a compilation error since both contract parameters and contract fields are used.
    // Uncommenting the next lines should trigger the documented error:
    // field1: Int;
    // field2: Int;
}

fun assignAfterDeclaration() {
    // This test below shows that a let declaration without an initializer is not allowed, per documentation.
    // let x: Int; // This line would cause a compilation error
    let x: Int = 42;
    dump(x);
}

// Future test targets:
// 1. Nested parentheses: Test the reported limit on nested parentheses by creating multiple nesting levels.
// 2. Nested try...catch and throw functions: Test detailed error handling and rollback behavior.

// The tests above conform with the official documentation.

// End of current fuzz-testing batch summary.
