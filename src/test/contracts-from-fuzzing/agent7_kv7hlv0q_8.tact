// Comprehensive Fuzz-Testing Cycle Summary
//
// We examined a variety of Tact documentation sections and systematically tested their claims using minimal code snippets. Our testing cycle included the following observations:
//
// 1. Variable Declarations:
//    - An attempt to use 'var' resulted in a compilation error, confirming that Tact requires the use of 'let' for variable declarations. This behavior is consistent with the language specification.
//
// 2. Getter Functions:
//    - According to the documentation, getter functions should not modify state. However, our test involving a getter function (in contract ModifyGetter) modifying a state variable compiled successfully. This reaffirms the noted discrepancy that while getters can modify state at runtime, the modifications are not persisted after the TVM execution. This behavior exactly mirrors previous observations from known issues.
//
// 3. Loop Constructs and Control Flow:
//    - The while loop construct (in contract WhileTest) worked as expected: it incremented a state variable until a condition was met.
//    - The repeat loop behavior was also confirmed; in our test, specifying a negative iteration count (repeat(-1)) resulted in the loop body being skipped as documented.
//    - A basic if/else conditional test compiled correctly and behaved as per the examples in the Tact documentation.
//
// Conclusion:
//
// Our fuzz-testing cycle has validated multiple significant claims from the Tact documentation. All tested features (variable declarations, getter functions, and various loop constructs) behaved as expected with one known discrepancy: getter functions are allowed to modify state at runtime, even though the documentation states otherwise. 
//
// No new bugs or severe issues were identified during this testing cycle, and the behavior is well aligned with what has been previously observed and documented.
//
// This completes the initial comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle. Further cycles will continue to explore additional language features and deeper corner cases.
