// Fuzz Testing Report for Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality

/*
Overview:
---------
This comprehensive fuzz-testing cycle focused on the bounced messages and the bounce receiver functionality within Tact contracts. Using guidelines from the official Tact documentation (e.g., bounced messages as described in citeturn0file0 and receiver function details in citeturn0file3), we created and compiled a series of minimal code snippets to validate the following aspects:

1. Standard Bounce Receiver (Typed):
   - A bounce receiver using a typed parameter (wrapped as bounced<T>) compiles successfully. This is demonstrated in the snippet for contract TestBounce.

2. Bounce Receiver with a Raw Slice:
   - Bounce receivers can also process raw cell slices by declaring the parameter as Slice. Our TestBounceRaw snippet confirmed this behavior.

3. Incorrect Bounce Receiver Declaration:
   - A bounce receiver declared without the proper bounced<T> wrapper (e.g. bounced(msg: MyMessage) {...}) is rightly rejected by the compiler. This case produced a compilation error, as expected from the documentation.

4. Recursive Bounce Simulation:
   - We implemented a recursive bounce system in the RecursiveBounce contract, where a bounced message triggers the sending of another bounce message (subject to a counter limit to avoid infinite recursion). This test case compiled successfully and demonstrates that recursive bouncing is possible provided proper constraints are applied.

5. Address Literal Handling:
   - An initial attempt using an invalid address literal (0:0) failed. After correction by supplying a properly encoded dummy constant address (with a valid 64 hex digit format), the send operation compiled as expected. This showcases the strict constant evaluation for addresses by the compiler.

Test Snippets Summary:
----------------------
// Correct Bounce Receiver (Typed)

message MyMessage {
    value: Int;
}

contract TestBounce {
    bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) {
        // Minimal bounce processing
    }
}

// Bounce Receiver accepting Raw Slice

contract TestBounceRaw {
    bounced(rawMsg: Slice) {
        // Minimal processing
    }
}

// Incorrect Bounce Receiver Declaration (should error)

contract IncorrectBounce2 {
    bounced(msg: MyMessage) {
        // Expected to fail as parameter is not wrapped in bounced<...>
    }
}

// Recursive Bounce Simulation

contract RecursiveBounce {
    myAddr: Address;
    counter: Int = 0;

    init(myAddr_: Address) {
        self.myAddr = myAddr_;
    }
    
    // Force a bounce by failing the receive
    receive() {
        require(false, "fail");
    }

    bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) {
        self.counter += 1;
        if (self.counter < 3) {
            send(SendParameters{
                to: self.myAddr,
                value: 0,
                bounce: true,
                mode: SendRemainingValue,
                body: MyMessage{ value: self.counter }.toCell()
            });
        }
    }
}

// Address literal handling: using a properly formatted dummy address

contract A {
    bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) {
        // Bounce receiver logic
    }

    receive() {
        // Use a dummy valid address initialized with a 64 hex-digit payload
        send(SendParameters{
            to: address("0:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"),
            value: 10,
            bounce: true,
            mode: 0,
            body: MyMessage{ value: 99 }.toCell()
        });
    }
}

Conclusion:
-----------
All tests confirm that the Tact compiler behaves in accordance with the official documentation:

- Bounce receivers must be declared with their respective types wrapped in bounced<T> or as a raw Slice.
- Incorrect bounce receiver definitions trigger compile-time errors.
- Recursive bounce handling is supported if managed carefully by the developer.
- Constant evaluation for address literals is enforced strictly.

No deviations or compiler bugs were found during this cycle, and the observed behavior is consistent with the documented specification for bounced messages.
