// Final summary based on our investigation of the earliest parts of the Tact docs

// We began by searching for and reviewing introductory sections of the Tact documentation. The docs_book_index.md ( ) provides an overview of the Tact Book, which introduces fundamental language constructs. Further details on basic statements, such as variable declarations, type inference, obtaining a Context via context(), and the use of block statements can be found in docs_book_statements.md ( ).

// Our goal was to validate those examples by compiling Tact snippets.
// Key observations:
// 1. 'let' statements: Both explicit "let value: Int = 123;" and inferred "let vInferred = 123;" compile correctly (as shown in docs_book_statements.md).
// 2. Built-in function context(): Using context() to retrieve a Context value works as documented.
// 3. Block statements: Grouping statements in blocks, with the option to omit the trailing semicolon, compiles as expected.
// 4. Function declarations: Module-level functions (e.g., getTimeFromNow) compile properly, which shows that Tact requires code to be encapsulated in functions. Attempting to declare top-level variables outside functions yields a compilation error by design.

fun getTimeFromNow(offset: Int): Int {
    return now() + offset;
}

fun testBasics() {
    // Validate variable declarations
    let value: Int = 123;
    let vInferred = 123;

    // Validate context() usage
    let vExplicitCtx: Context = context();
    let vCtx = context();

    // Validate block usage with optional trailing semicolon
    {
        let blockValue = 2 + 2;
        dump(blockValue);
    }
}

// Conclusion:
// Our compilation tests confirm that the earliest parts of the Tact documentation—covering 'let' declarations, type inference, context retrieval, block statements, and top-level function definitions—compile and work as described. 
// There is no misinformation or discrepancy evident in these fundamental examples.
