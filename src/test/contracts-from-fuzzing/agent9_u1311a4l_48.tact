// Final Consolidated Fuzz-Testing Report on Bounced Messages and Bounce Receiver Functionality

/*
Final Summary Report:
---------------------

Through an extensive and systematic fuzz-testing cycle, we examined the behavior of bounced messages and bounce receiver functions in Tact contracts in a variety of scenarios. Our approach involved generating minimal code snippets that tested both the valid and edge-case usage as documented. The key findings are summarized below:

1. Standard Bounce Receiver Usage:
   • Bounce receivers declared with a custom message type (e.g., using:
         bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) { ... }
     ) compile successfully. This confirms that the basic usage fully adheres to the guidelines presented in the official documentation (refer to the bounced messages section in docs_book_bounced.md).

2. Invalid Receiver Declarations:
   • Bounce receiver functions defined with an improper parameter type (for instance, Int, Cell) or declared without any parameters produced clear compile-time errors. The compiler enforces that only parameters of type bounced<T>, recognized message types, or Slice are permitted. This behavior is exactly as prescribed in the contracts documentation (see docs_book_contracts.md for receiver function details).

3. Fallback Handling via Slice Parameter:
   • Bounce receivers that use a raw Slice (e.g., bounced(rawMsg: Slice)) compile without issues, providing a catch-all mechanism to handle all bounced messages—just as recommended in the documentation.

4. State Modification Capabilities:
   • Bounce receiver functions demonstrated that state modifications (such as updating a counter) are permitted. This is an important distinction compared to getter functions, which cannot modify state, and it confirms the flexibility intended for receiver functions in Tact (refer to docs_book_contracts.md for contextual insights).

5. Unique Receiver Enforcement:
   • Attempts to define more than one bounce receiver for the same message type correctly triggered conflict errors, thereby enforcing a one-to-one mapping between a bounced message type and its handler.

6. Advanced Control Flow and Error Handling:
   • Use of try-catch blocks (with the necessary syntax corrections) within bounce receivers compiled successfully. Moreover, advanced patterns involving recursive and cross-contract bounce handling (using self.reply() and self.notify()) were shown to behave as documented (see docs_book_send.md for outbound messaging examples).

7. Message Size Limit Enforcement:
   • In tests where the bounced message’s payload exceeded the 224 usable data bits limit, the compiler produced appropriate errors. This strict enforcement validates the documented limitation on bounced message sizes.

Conclusion:
-----------
Every test case—ranging from standard valid usage to extreme edge-case error conditions—confirmed that the Tact compiler’s handling of bounced messages and bounce receivers is robust and precisely adherent to the official documentation. No discrepancies or unexpected behaviors were identified during this cycle, which confirms that bounce handling in Tact is implemented reliably as specified.

Future testing will continue to explore further features of the language, but this cycle instills high confidence in the correct operation of bounce receivers and bounced message processing.

End of Fuzz-Testing Cycle.
