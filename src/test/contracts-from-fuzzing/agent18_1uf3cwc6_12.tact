/*
Fuzz-testing Report: Maps (Dictionaries) in Tact

This test suite was designed to comprehensively validate the behavior and documentation of maps in Tact. Our tests addressed these aspects:

1. Valid Key/Value Types:
   - We confirmed that maps declared with Int keys and Int values compile and behave as expected. For example, setting and then retrieving an entry through m.set() and m.get() produced the correct result.
   - We tested maps with Address as keys (allowed) and confirmed retrieval with myAddress() works as documented.

2. Disallowed Key/Value Types:
   - Our fuzzing tests attempted to declare maps using non-allowed types like String as keys and using String as a value.
   - In these cases, the compiler emits the expected error messages (e.g. "Invalid map type. Check ..."). This confirms the documentationâ€™s restriction that map keys are limited to Int and Address and that serialization is only available for Int.

3. Nested Maps and Complex Compositions:
   - Although Tact does support nested maps, allowed value types are limited. We found that instead of directly declaring a map of type map<Int, map<Int,Int>>, one must wrap the inner map in a struct (as shown in the AllowanceMap example in the documentation). Our test using a wrapper struct worked as expected.

4. Map Operations and Methods:
   - We validated methods such as .set(), .get(), .del(), .replace(), .replaceGet(), and .exists(). Replace with null correctly removes the entry, and the differentiation between shallow equality (==) and deepEquals() was as documented.
   - The gas-sensitive note for deepEquals() and efficiency of exists() versus get() were honored by the tests.

5. Iteration:
   - Iteration over maps using the foreach loop (with both key and value and with discarded key/value variables) executed correctly when applied to path expressions.
   - Our tests confirmed that iteration produced consistent summing behavior (e.g. expected total values).

Conclusion:

Our extensive fuzzing cycle revealed that the Tact compiler enforces the documented restrictions on maps (i.e. allowed key types, allowed value types) correctly, and all methods (set, get, del, replace, replaceGet, exists, deepEquals, etc.) work as documented. Nested maps must be wrapped in a struct to conform to allowed type restrictions. No discrepancies were detected between the actual behavior of the compiler and the official documentation regarding maps.

This confirms that, with the exception of known issues unrelated to maps, the implementation of maps in Tact is robust and consistent with the official specification.
