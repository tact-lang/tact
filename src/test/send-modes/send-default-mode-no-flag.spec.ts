   The summary of the test is as follows:

   1) The treasury will send a message to the tester, indicating the tester to start a 
      request to the calculator for computing the average of the interval [0,4].
      
   2) The tester creates an AverageRequest message (SendDefaultMode with no flags), 
      indicating that it will include 1 TON in the "value" of the message.
      The tester also includes in its request that the Calculator should pay 1 TON when it sends its response back to the tester.

   3) During the action phase, message forward fees will be deducted from the 1 TON payed by the tester. The message is sent
      to the calculator with a final value of: "1 TON - message forward fees". Call this value "ReqV" (i.e., Request Value).

   4) The calculator receives the message. An amount of ReqV TONs (i.e., the value in the incoming message) 
      is added to the calculator's balance. 
    
   5) The calculator computes the average of the interval [0,4], producing 2 as result. All the transaction fees
      are deducted from the calculator's balance. 

   6) The calculator creates an AverageResult message (SendDefaultMode with no flags), 
      indicating that it will include 1 TON in the "value" of the message.
   
   7) During the action phase of the calculator, message forward fees will be deducted from the 1 TON payed by the calculator. 
      The message is sent to the tester with a final value of: "1 TON - message forward fees". 
      Call this value "ResV" (i.e., Response Value).

   8) The tester receives the message. An amount of ResV TONs (i.e., the value in the incoming message)
      is added to the tester's balance. The tester updates its "val" field with the result of the computation.

   Summary of transactions:

   T1) Triggered by message sent from treasury to tester. Sends average request to calculator.
   T2) Triggered by message sent from tester to calculator. Computes average and sends response back to tester.
   T3) Triggered by message sent from calculator to tester. Sets the result of the computation into the "val" field in the tester.

        /* In SendDefaultMode with no flags, outbound messages must pay for forward fees. The forward fees are deducted from the 
       initial "value" passed as parameter to the send function. So that if we execute:

       send(SendParameters{
                ......
                value: V,
                ......
                });

       the message final value is: V - msg_fwd_fee
       
       where msg_fwd_fee is the forward fee computed during the action phase.

       Additionally, one fraction of msg_fwd_fee is assigned as forward fees for the blockchain validators:
       https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees-low-level#formula-1
       (Confusingly, the TON docs call "msg forward fee" the message forward fee computed during the action phase,
       and "forward fee" the fraction of "msg forward fee" given to the validators).
       The fraction that was not assigned as forward fees for the validators is assigned as action fees.

       The following figure may help in visualizing the above concepts:

       Imagine this chunk represents the amount payed by the contract in its send function, for example, the 1 TON
       payed by the tester in its request to the calculator:

       |-----------------------------------------------|

       During the action phase, an amount of msg_fwd_fee will be removed from the above chunk (i.e., the message forward fees):

       |--------------------|--------------------------|
             final value             msg_fwd_fee    

       Additionally, a fraction of msg_fwd_fee will be reserved as forward fees for validators, while the rest will be deemed
       to be action fees:

       |--------------------|--------------|-----------|
             final value         fwd_fee     action fee
                                      msg_fwd_fee 

       When the message is sent to the calculator, the message will carry the final value chunk and the fwd_fee chunk. 
       During the message transit, the fwd_fee chunk is consumed by the validators, and when the message arrives to 
       the calculator, the "final value" chunk is added to the calculator's balance.

       The above computation is carried out for each sent message. 
       In this test, since each action phase in every transaction sends a single message, we can extract msg_fwd_fee from
       the total message forward fee computed in the action phase of the transaction object.
       This is what we are going to do now in order to check that the final value of the outbound messages 
       are actually their initial value minus the message forward fees.

       The summary of the test is as follows:
    
       1) The treasury will send a message to the tester, indicating the tester to start a 
          request to the calculator for computing the average of the interval [0,50]. 
          
       2) During the computation phase, the tester creates an AverageRequest message (SendDefaultMode with no flags), 
          including 0.005 TON in the "value" of the message. This amount is NOT enough to cover the
          calculator's transaction fees and message forward fees for the bounced message. 
          The tester sets its "val" contract field to -3 ("op requested, no answer yet").
          The computation phase for the tester contract succeeds. 
    
       3) The action phase for the tester contract successfully sends the request.
    
       4) The calculator receives the request and aborts its computation phase because computing the interval [0,50] 
          takes too much gas. 
       
       5) The calculator skips its action phase, but enters its bounce phase. 
          The calculator does NOT send a bounced message back to the tester, because there are not enough funds 
          left in the incoming request to pay for message forward fees (after the computation fees
          were deducted from the value in the incoming message).
        
       6) The tester remains with contract field "val" set to -3 ("op requested, no answer yet").

       Summary of transactions:
    
       T1) Triggered by message sent from treasury to tester. Sends request to calculator to compute 
           average of interval [0,50] with NOT enough funds to pay for the calculator's transaction fees.
        
       T2) Triggered by the message sent from tester to calculator. The transaction is aborted during the 
           computation phase (due to an out of gas error). No bounced message is sent back to the tester
           because there are no funds left in the incoming request.

          since the response message does not have funds to pay for forward fees.

           average of interval [0,4] with enough funds to pay for the calculator's transaction fees.
        
       T2) Triggered by the message sent from tester to calculator. The transaction passes the computation 
           phase but fails its action phase because the calculator did not include enough funds to pay for forward
           fees in the response message. No response message is sent back to the tester.

           where inValue = value in the incoming message
                 
                 totalFees = total transaction fees  (i.e., storage fees + import external message fees + 
             computation fees + action fees + outbound external message fees)
             see https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees#basic-fees-formula
                 
                 outMsgInfo.value = value in the outbound message

                 outMsgInfo.validatorsForwardFee = validator's forward fee in the outbound message
                 
           The rationale for the formula is as follows:
               
            1) The value of the incoming message is added to the contract's balance. This explains the positive sign in inValue.
            2) All transaction fees are subtracted from the contract's balance. This explains the negative sign in totalFees.
            3) For the outbound message, we need to remove from the contract's balance the amount set in the send function.
               However, we need to be careful. Why? Recall the diagram of how the amount payed by the contract in the send function
               is split into "final value", message forward fees (msg_fwd_fee), forward fees for validators (fwd_fee), and action fees:
 
               ----Total amount payed by contract in the send function-------
               |                                                            |
               v                                                            v
               |------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
                           final value        /\  fwd_fee       action fee  /\
                                               |                             |
                                               ---------msg_fwd_fee----------- 
            
                Note that in the formula for the totalFees, the action fees already occur as a term. Therefore, if we subtract 
                the total amount payed by the contract in the send function, we would be subtracting the action fees TWICE.
                Hence, we should only subtract the "final value" (contained in outMsgInfo.value)
                and the forward fees for validators (contained in outMsgInfo.validatorsForwardFee).
