    /* Evaluate all comp-time expressions:
       constants, default contract fields, default struct fields, method Ids
       
       The original code inside constant, field and method id initialization actually mutated the CompilerContext object, 
       while the rest of the typechecker's code built a new CompilerContext every time it changed something.
       Hence the reason of why this line is not written as:

       ctx = evalComptimeExpressions(ctx, ast);

       The code mutates fields in ConstantDescription, FieldDescription and FunctionDescription.

       Evaluation of Message op-codes is done later in resolveSignatures. It was left there because 
       the computation of those op-codes is more involved than the computation of method ids, and so
       it is hard to extract the call to evalConstantExpression in resolveSignatures.
