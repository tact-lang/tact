# Styleguide

Due to stringent security and correctness requirements we have to use a subset of TypeScript features that are known to be _less unsound_.

## Do

Prefer the most simple and basic language features.

- Variables `const x = f()`
- Functions `(x: T) => x`, `f(x)`
- Objects `{ foo: 'bar' }`, `x.foo`, `const { foo } = x;`
- Statements `if`, `for`, `return`
- Aliases `type F<T> = { foo: T }`
- Simple types `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `undefined`
- Literal types `1`, `"hello"`
- Unions of literal types `1 | 2 | 3`
- Tagged unions `{ kind: 'A', a: number } | { kind: 'B' }`

## Don't

### Don't explicitly break type system

- **Don't use `as`**, except `as const`. It was meant for gradually typing legacy code, not for production use in TS-native projects. Often `x as T` actually was meant to be `const y: T = x;` or `x satisfies T`.
- **Don't use `any`.** Its actual meaning is "completely disregard type errors here". Prefer `unknown` or `never`.
- **Don't use guard types `x is T`.** These are just `as` in disguise. Might be used in very simple cases, such as ADT boilerplate.
- **Don't use overloading**. It's almost the same as intersection types, and intersection types are broken.
- **Don't use `@ts-ignore`.** It's a worse version of `as` that can take TS compiler into an arbitrary incorrect state.
- **Don't use `x!` operator.** It does no checks at runtime, and is essentially `x as NotNull<typeof x>`.
- **Don't pick into values that are generic** `<T>(x: T) => typeof x === 'number'`. Properly designed languages do not allow this.

Workarounds for bugs in compiler will sometimes require an `as` or `any`. In this case the workaround should be small and generic, separated into its own file, and annotated with reference to TypeScript issue.

For example, `["a", "b"].includes(x)` doesn't narrow `x` to `'a' | 'b'`. Instead of multiple `x as ('a' | 'b')` over the whole codebase we can define a wrapper once in `util.ts`, thoroughly test and review it, and keep it in containment this way.

```typescript
// `extends string` is usually a bad idea, but `key is K` is an even worse idea
export const includes = <const K extends string>(
  keys: readonly K[],
  key: string,
): key is K => {
  // we have to do this, otherwise next line will complain that `key` isn't `K`
  const keys1: readonly string[] = keys;
  return keys1.includes(key);
};
```

### Don't use mutability unless required

- **Don't use `let`.** Most likely it should be a separate function where each assignment is a `return`.
- **Never use `var`.** They're hoisted up to the function or module scope. `for (var i = 0; i < n; ++i) a.push(() => i)` creates an array of functions referencing the same value of `i === n`.
- **Never use `let` in tests.** `jest` execution order is hard to understand, and most likely it will lead to flaky tests.
- **Never use `let` global variables.** These break tree-shaking, make code untestable, make behavior dependent on module initialization order.
- **Don't assign to function arguments** `(x) => { x = 1; }`
- **Don't use `for (let ...)` loops.** Prefer built-in array methods.
- **All object fields must be `readonly`**: `{ readonly foo: string }`.
- **Tag fields on tagged unions absolutely have to be readonly.** By assigning into a tag field of a `A | B` union, we can narrow it to an `A` type while it will have `B` (or some arbitrary combination of `A` and `B`) at runtime.
- **Arrays should be readonly**: `readonly string[]`
- **Tuples should be readonly**: `readonly [string, number]`
- **`Set` and `Map` should be readonly**: `env: ReadonlyMap<string, Type>`
- **Clone arrays before `.sort()`, `.reverse()`, `.splice()`**: `[...arr].sort()`
- **Prefer freezing highly reused objects** with `Object.freeze`.
- **Avoid `void` type.**

### Don't use untagged unions

- **Don't use untagged non-literal unions** `{ a: 1 } | { b: 2 }`. These will require an `in`-condition for narrowing to select either of branches.
- **Don't use `in`.** TypeScript has no distinction between open and closed object types. There might be no field in an object type, but there will be one at runtime. Narrowing for `in` operators is also buggy in other ways, and doesn't properly apply to either of its arguments.

### Don't use JS object "features"

- **Don't use optional fields** `foo?: Bar`. Every `?` doubles number of cases that should be tested. Eventually some combination of non-defined and undefined fields will be non-semantic.
- _**Don't use optional fields**_. In JS there is a distinction between field that is not defined and a field that is `undefined` (sic). `'a' in {} === false`, `'a' in { a: undefined } === true`. TypeScript doesn't handle this properly in its type system.
- **Don't use `Proxy`**. These break type safety, are incorrectly handled in debuggers, lead to very unexpected heisenbugs.
- **Don't use `get` and `set`**. See `Proxy` above.
- **Don't use `...` with objects**. It will require intersection types or inheritance to type. Prefer aggregation: `{ ...a, b }` â†’ `{ a, b }`.
- **Don't use `interface ... extends`**. There is no way to safely distinguish objects supporting parent and child interfaces at runtime.
  - Except where it's required to untie type recursion. For example `type Foo = A<Foo>` would only work as `interface Foo extends A<Foo> {}`
- **Don't use objects as `Map`s**. Objects have a set of quirks: numeric keys get listed before string keys, key order is not guaranteed, keys can be inherited from `Object.prototype`, `__proto__` key can be used for prototype pollution exploits. Unless very high performance of hashmap is needed, or an object is statically defined, use `Map`.

### Don't use JS function "features"

- **Don't use optional parameters** `(x?: number) => {}`. TypeScript has a quirk that allows passing function with less arguments to parameter that requires more. Eventually this leads to passing unexpected values to optional parameters. Prefer decomposing the function into two, where one takes full set of parameters, and the other one is a simpler version that takes less.
- **Don't use default parameters** `(x = 1) => {}`. See reasoning above.
- **Don't use `...rest` parameters**. TypeScript doesn't have "mapped tuple types", so typing these will be problematic. In most cases passing an array would suffice, and would only take two more characters to type.
- **Don't use `arguments`**. This is a worse version of `...rest` that isn't even an array.
- **Don't pass functions directly** to built-in functions `.map(foo)`. A good example of why this is a bad idea: `["10", "10", "10"].map(parseInt)`. Prefer `.map(x => foo(x))`.

### Don't use OOP

- **Don't use methods**. Methods don't store reference to `this` in their closure, and take it from object _syntactically_, i.e. `x.f()` would use `x` as `this`. It means `const { f } = x; f();` will be a runtime error, and TypeScript would emit no error here at compile time.
- **Don't use inheritance**. Overriding is allowed in JS, Liskov substitution is not guaranteed.
- **Don't use `class`**. In TS `private` is only a type system feature, and all the private fields are globally accessible at runtime. Worse, created objects have part of their description in `prototype`, and can't be worked with as regular objects. If class is converted to regular function, all the fields are properly private, accessing them requires no `this.` prefix, and in most frequent case there is only one exposed method that can be returned directly.

### Don't use funny types

- **Don't use conditional types**. These lack any theory behind them, and were meant to type legacy JS code.
- **Don't use `Omit`, `Pick`, `Exclude` and `Extract`**. These are conditional types in disguise.
- **Don't use mapped object types** `{ [K in keyof T]: ... }`. These lack any theory behind them, don't have introducing syntax, and are buggy.
- **Don't use index types** `T["foo"]`. They disregard variance at their use site, and most likely will pin types in another library/module with both lower and upper bounds, thus they're very detrimental to modularity. Most likely type of `foo` field should be defined separately.
- **Don't use indexed types** `{ [k: string]: number }`. It's `Record<string, number>`. The only valid case is to avoid type recursion quirks in TS: `type Json = null | boolean | number | string | Json[] | { [k: string]: Json }` would emit error with `Record<string, Json>`
- **Don't define bounds on generic parameters** `<T extends (foo: number) => string>`. Type inference is broken here, and in many cases will force TS to infer type of bound instead of expected type.
- **Don't use intersection types** `A & B`. They are so broken it's hard to even count them as intersection types.
- **Don't use `Object`, `object`, `{}`, `Function`**. There's barely a case when common supertypes of objects and functions are even needed.

### Don't use arcane language "features"

- **Don't use `export default`**. It breaks IDE features such as renaming, and also has complex semantics.
- **Don't use `while`** loops. Every iteration must have at least an explicit "fuel" check. `while` _always_ eventually leads to infinite loops.
- **Don't use `for (... in ...)`**. It requires `hasOwnProperty` check. Prefer `Object.entries`, `Object.keys` or `Object.values`.
- **Don't define `toString` and `toJSON`** on objects. These obfuscate results of `console.log`, make objects different depending on the way they're logged (`util.inspect` wouldn't use them).
- **Don't use `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify`** without `zod`. Both functions have very broken types: `JSON.stringify(undefined)`.

### Other considerations

- **Beware of `${}`** in template strings. Any inlining succeeds, and there won't be any compile-time errors even if it's a function `${(x: number) => x}`.
- **Avoid `null`**. `typeof null === 'object'`, and there is `undefined` anyway.
- **Avoid exceptions**. Exceptions are untyped.
- **Avoid tuples**. TS gives them minimal distinction from arrays, and type system is broken around them. Occasionally for performance reasons tuples might be a better option than objects.
- **Avoid `enum`**. It's equivalent to unions since 5.0, except generates boilerplate JS code. A version that doesn't generate extraneous code, `const enum`, is not properly supported by `babel`.
- **Avoid iterators**. They're untypable unless fixed in JS standard. Prefer generators. Prefer iterating with `for (... of ...)`.
