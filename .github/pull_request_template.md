Closes #number

<!--
IMPORTANT:
If your PR doesn't close a particular issue, please, create the issue first and describe the whole context: what you're adding/changing and why you're doing so. And only then open the Pull Request, which would close that issue!

In case you are adding a new language feature, a standard library function or introducing other user-facing changes, you need to document them via a new PR to tact-docs.
