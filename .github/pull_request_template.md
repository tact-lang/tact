- [ ] I have updated CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] I have added tests to demonstrate the contribution is correctly implemented: this usually includes both positive and negative tests, showing the happy path(s) and featuring intentionally broken cases
- [ ] I have run all the tests locally and no test failure was reported
- [ ] I did not do unrelated and/or undiscussed refactorings
