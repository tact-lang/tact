If your PR doesn't close a particular issue, please, create the issue first and describe the whole context: what you're adding/changing and why you're doing so. And only then open the Pull Request, which would close that issue!

* [ ] I have updated CHANGELOG.md
* [ ] I have added unit tests to check possible regressions (if your PR introduces new error messages, each of those should have a distinct test case)
* [ ] I did not introduce unrelated formatting/whitespace changes in the code base
* [ ] I did not do unrelated and/or undiscussed refactorings
