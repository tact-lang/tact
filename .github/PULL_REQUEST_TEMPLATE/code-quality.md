IMPORTANT:
If your PR doesn't close a particular issue, please, create the issue first and describe the whole context: what you're adding/changing and why you're doing so. And only then open the Pull Request, which would close that issue!

IMPORTANT:
In general, the Tact team does not accept refactorings from external contributors unless those were previously discussed and you've got the green light to change things without adding new functionality or to fix something broken. Language features, bugfixes, doc improvements are more than welcome!
