The most prominent and distinctive features of Tact are:

- Familiar and user-friendly TypeScript-like syntax.
- Strong static type system with built-in [Structs], [Messages] and [maps], among others.
- First-class [maps] support, with many methods and a convenient [`foreach` statement][foreach] for traversing.
- Automatic (de)serialization of incoming messages and data structures.
- Automatic routing of [internal, external and bounced messages][recvfun].
- Automatic handling of message types, including [binary, text, and fallback slices][recv].
- No boilerplate functions for [sending messages] and deploying child contracts.
- Reusable behaviors through [traits].
- Support for low-level programming with [`asm` functions][asmfun].
- Rich [standard library][stdlib].
- Extensive [documentation].
- Robust [tooling](#tooling).
- ...and there's much more to come!

## Installation

### Compiler

The Tact compiler is distributed as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tact-lang/compiler) bundled with the [Tact standard library](https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/).

The recommended Node.js version is 22 or higher, while the bare minimum Node.js version must be at least 18 or higher.

Use your favorite package manager to install it into a Node.js project:

```shell
# yarn is recommended, but not required
yarn add @tact-lang/compiler

# you can also use npm
npm i @tact-lang/compiler@latest

# or pnpm
pnpm add @tact-lang/compiler

# or bun
bun add @tact-lang/compiler
```

Alternatively, you can install it globally as such:

```shell
npm i -g @tact-lang/compiler
```

This will make the `tact` compiler available on your PATH, as well as a convenient `unboc` disassembler of a contract's code compiled into a [Bag of Cells](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/cells/#cells-boc) `.boc` format.

### Getting started

For a quick start, read the ["Let's start!"](https://docs.tact-lang.org/#start) mini-guide in the Tact documentation, which uses the [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-community/blueprint) development environment for writing, testing and deploying smart contracts on TON Blockchain.

If you want more manual control, use [tact-template](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-template) â€” it's a ready-to-use template with the development environment set up, including the Tact compiler with TypeScript + Jest, a local TON emulator, AI-based editor support, and examples of how to run tests.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-template
```
