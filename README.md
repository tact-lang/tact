## Installation

### Compiler

The Tact compiler is distributed as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tact-lang/compiler) bundled with the [Tact standard library](https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/).

The recommended Node.js version is 22 or higher, while the bare minimum Node.js version must be at least 18 or higher.

Use your favorite package manager to install it into a Node.js project:

```shell
# yarn is recommended, but not required
yarn add @tact-lang/compiler

# you can also use npm
npm i @tact-lang/compiler@latest

# or pnpm
pnpm add @tact-lang/compiler

# or bun
bun add @tact-lang/compiler
```

Alternatively, you can install it globally as such:

```shell
npm i -g @tact-lang/compiler
```

This will make the `tact` compiler available on your PATH, as well as a convenient `unboc` disassembler of a contract's code compiled into a [Bag of Cells](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/cells/#cells-boc) `.boc` format.

### Tooling

  - Get it on the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/tonstudio/vscode-tact).
  - Or install from the [`.vsix` files in nightly releases](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server/releases).
- [Language Server (LSP Server)](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server) - Supports Sublime Text, (Neo)Vim, Helix, and other editors with LSP support.
- [tact.vim](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact.vim) - Vim 8+ plugin.

### Getting started

For a quick start, read the ["Let's start!"](https://docs.tact-lang.org/#start) mini-guide in the Tact documentation, which uses the [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-community/blueprint) development environment for writing, testing and deploying smart contracts on TON Blockchain.

If you want more manual control, use [tact-template](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-template) - it's a ready-to-use template with the development environment set up, including the Tact compiler with TypeScript + Jest, a local TON emulator, AI-based editor support, and examples of how to run tests.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-template
```
