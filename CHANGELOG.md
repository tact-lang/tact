### Changed

- Update the `dump` function to handle addresses: PR [#175](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/pull/175)
- Support trailing commas in all comma-separated lists (struct instantiations, `initOf` arguments, `init()` parameters, inherited traits via `with`, function arguments and parameters): PR [#179](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/pull/179) and PR [#246](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/pull/246)
- The implicit empty `init` function is now present by default in the contract if not declared: PR [#167](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/pull/167)
- `@stdlib/stoppable` now imports `@stdlib/ownable` so the programmer does not have to do it separately: PR [#193](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/pull/193)
- Support escape sequences for strings (`\\`, `\"`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\v`, `\b`, `\f`, `\u{0}` through `\u{FFFFFF}`, `\u0000` through `\uFFFF`, `\x00` through `\xFF`): PR [#192](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/pull/192)
