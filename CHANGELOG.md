### ⚡️ Breaking changes

- `reply` is now a method of `Contract` instead of global context and changed it's behavior if storage reserve is non-zero in contract.
- Logical expressions are now calculated differently: `&&` now does not execute right expression if left is `false` and `||` does not execute right expression if left is `true`. Before it was executed in any case. This change is made in attempt to reduce unexpected behavior.
- `OwnableTransferable` is now sends response to the sender.
- `overwrites` was renamed to `override`
- `Deployable` trait now sends non-bounceable notifications instead of bounceable ones.

- `forward` and `notify` functions that can be used to send messages to other contracts using remaining value of incoming message

- `storageReserve` constant in every contract that can be used to reserve some storage space by any trait
- `abstract` functions that can be implemented in contracts
